<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p class="drop-capw"><span class="smcap">At</span> the request of my publishers I have written
<cite>A Book of Dartmoor</cite>. I had already dealt
with this upland district in two chapters in my
<cite>Book of the West</cite>, vol. i., "Devon." But in their
opinion this wild and wondrous region deserved
more particular treatment than I had been able to
accord to it in the limited space at my disposal in
the above-mentioned book.</p>

<p>I have now entered with some fulness, but by no
means exhaustively, into the subject; and for those
who desire a closer acquaintance with, and a more
precise guide to the several points of interest on
"the moor," I would indicate three works that have
preceded this.</p>

<p>1. Mr. J. Brooking Rowe in 1896 republished the
<cite>Perambulation of Dartmoor</cite>, first issued by his great-uncle,
Mr. Samuel Rowe, in 1848.</p>

<p>The original work was written by a man whose
mind was steeped in the crude archæological theories
of his period. The new editor could not dispense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
with this matter, which pervaded the work, without a
complete recasting of the book, and this he was reluctant
to attempt. He limited himself to cautioning
the reader to put no trust in these exploded theories.
The result is that the reader is tripping over uncertain
ground, never knowing what is to be accepted
and what rejected.</p>

<p>2. Mr. J. H. W. Page's <cite>Exploration of Dartmoor</cite>,
1889, is admirable as a guide. The author, however,
was unhappily ignorant of prehistoric archæology,
and allowed himself to be led astray by the false
antiquarianism that had marked the early writers.
Consequently, his book is capital as a guide to what
is to be seen, but eminently unreliable in its explanation
of the character and age of the antiquities.</p>

<p>3. A capital book is Mr. W. Crossing's <cite>Amid
Devonia's Alps</cite>, 1888, which is wholly free from
pseudo-antiquarianism. It is brief, it is small and
cheap, and an admirable handbook for pedestrians.</p>

<p>In no way do I desire to supersede these works.
I have taken pains rather to supplement them than
to step into the places occupied by their writers.</p>

<p>The plan I have adopted in this gossiping volume
is to give a general idea of the moor and of its
antiquities&mdash;the latter as interpreted by up-to-date
archæologists&mdash;and then to suggest rambles made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
from certain stations on the fringe, or in the heart of
the region.</p>

<p>Here and there it has been inevitable that I should
twice mention the same object of interest, once in
the introductory portion, and again when I have to
refer to it as coming within the radius of a proposed
ramble.</p>

<p>As a boy I had an uncle, T. G. Bond, who lived
near Moreton Hampstead, and who was passionately
devoted to Dartmoor. He inspired me with the
same love. In 1848 he presented me, as a birthday
present, with Rowe's <cite>Perambulation of Dartmoor</cite>.
It arrested my attention, engaged my imagination,
and was to me almost as a Bible. When I obtained
a holiday from my books, I mounted my pony and
made for the moor. I rode over it, round it, put up
at little inns, talked with the moormen, listened to
their tales and songs in the evenings, and during the
day sketched and planned the relics that I then
fondly supposed were Druidical.</p>

<p>The child is father to the man. Years have rolled
away. I have wandered over Europe, have rambled
to Iceland, climbed the Alps, been for some years
lodged among the marshes of Essex&mdash;yet nothing
that I have seen has quenched in me the longing
after the fresh air, and love of the wild scenery of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
Dartmoor. There is far finer mountain scenery elsewhere,
but there can be no more bracing air, and the
lone upland region possesses a something of its own&mdash;a
charm hard to describe, but very real&mdash;which
engages for once and for ever the affections of those
who have made its acquaintance. "After all said,"
observed my uncle to me one day, when my father
had dilated on the glories of the Pyrenees, "Dartmoor
is to itself, and to me&mdash;a passion." And to his
memory I dedicate this volume.</p>

<p>My grateful thanks are due to Messrs. R. Burnard,
P. F. S. Amery, J. Shortridge, and C. E. Robinson
for permission to employ photographs taken by
them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />

BOGS</h2>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>The rivers that flow from Dartmoor&mdash;The bogs are their cradles&mdash;A
tailor lost on the moor&mdash;A man in Aune Mire&mdash;Some of the worst
bogs&mdash;Cranmere Pool&mdash;How the bogs are formed&mdash;Adventure in
Redmoor Bog&mdash;Bog plants&mdash;The buckbean&mdash;Sweet gale&mdash;Furze&mdash;Yellow
broom&mdash;Bee-keeping.</p></div>


<p class="drop-capw"><span class="smcap">Dartmoor</span> proper consists of that upland
region of granite, rising to nearly 2,000 feet
above the sea, and actually shooting above that
height at a few points, which is the nursery of many
of the rivers of Devon.</p>

<p>The Exe, indeed, has its source in Exmoor, and it
disdains to receive any affluents from Dartmoor; and
the Torridge takes its rise hard by the sea at Wellcombe,
within a rifle-shot of the Bristol Channel,
nevertheless it makes a graceful sweep&mdash;tenders a
salute&mdash;to Dartmoor, and in return receives the
liberal flow of the Okement. The Otter and the
Axe, being in the far east of the county, rise in the
range of hills that form the natural frontier between
Devon and Somerset.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>But all the other considerable streams look back
upon Dartmoor as their mother.</p>

<p>And what a mother! She sends them forth limpid
and pure, full of laughter and leap, of flash and brawl.
She does not discharge them laden with brown mud,
as the Exe, nor turned like the waters of Egypt to
blood, as the Creedy.</p>

<p>A prudent mother, she feeds them regularly, and
with considerable deliberation. Her vast bogs act as
sponges, absorbing the winter rains, and only leisurely
and prudently does she administer the hoarded supply,
so that the rivers never run dry in the hottest and
most rainless summers.</p>

<p>Of bogs there are two sorts, the great parental
peat deposits that cover the highland, where not
too steep for them to lie, and the swamps in the
bottoms formed by the oozings from the hills that
have been arrested from instant discharge into the
rivers by the growth of moss and water-weeds, or
are checked by belts of gravel and boulder. To
see the former, a visit should be made to Cranmere
Pool, or to Cut Hill, or Fox Tor Mire. To get into
the latter a stroll of ten minutes up a river-bank will
suffice.</p>

<p>The existence of the great parent bogs is due
either to the fact that beneath them lies the impervious
granite, as a floor, somewhat concave, or to the
whole rolling upland being covered, as with a quilt,
with equally impervious china-clay, the fine deposit
of feldspar washed from the granite in the course
of ages.</p>

<p>In the depths of the moor the peat may be seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
riven like floes of ice, and the rifts are sometimes
twelve to fourteen feet deep, cut through black vegetable
matter, the product of decay of plants through
countless generations. If the bottom be sufficiently
denuded it is seen to be white and smooth as a girl's
shoulder&mdash;the kaolin that underlies all.</p>

<p>On the hillsides, and in the bottoms, quaking-bogs
may be lighted upon or tumbled into. To light upon
them is easy enough, to get out of one if tumbled into
is a difficult matter. They are happily small, and
can be at once recognised by the vivid green pillow
of moss that overlies them. This pillow is sufficiently
close in texture and buoyant to support a man's
weight, but it has a mischievous habit of thinning
around the edge, and if the water be stepped into
where this fringe is, it is quite possible for the inexperienced
to go under, and be enabled at his leisure to
investigate the lower surface of the covering <em>duvet</em> of
porous moss. Whether he will be able to give to the
world the benefit of his observations may be open to
question.</p>

<p>The thing to be done by anyone who gets into
such a bog is to spread his arms out&mdash;this will
prevent his sinking&mdash;and if he cannot struggle out,
to wait, cooling his toes in bog water, till assistance
comes. It is a difficult matter to extricate horses
when they flounder in, as is not infrequently the
case in hunting; every plunge sends the poor beasts
in deeper.</p>

<p>One afternoon, in the year 1851, I was in the
Walkham valley above Merrivale Bridge digging into
what at the time I fondly believed was a tumulus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
but which I subsequently discovered to be a mound
thrown up for the accommodation of rabbits, when
a warren was contemplated on the slope of Mis Tor.</p>

<p>Towards evening I was startled to see a most
extraordinary object approach me&mdash;a man in a
draggled, dingy, and disconsolate condition, hardly
able to crawl along. When he came up to me he
burst into tears, and it was some time before I
could get his story from him. He was a tailor of
Plymouth, who had left his home to attend the
funeral of a cousin at Sampford Spiney or Walkhampton,
I forget which. At that time there was
no railway between Tavistock and Launceston;
communication was by coach.</p>

<p>When the tailor, on the coach, reached Roborough
Down, "'Ere you are!" said the driver. "You go
along there, and you can't miss it!" indicating a
direction with his whip.</p>

<p>So the tailor, in his glossy black suit, and with his
box-hat set jauntily on his head, descended from
the coach, leaped into the road, his umbrella, also
black, under his arm, and with a composed countenance
started along the road that had been pointed
out.</p>

<p>Where and how he missed his way he could not
explain, nor can I guess, but instead of finding
himself at the house of mourning, and partaking there
of cake and gin, and dropping a sympathetic tear,
he got up on to Dartmoor, and got&mdash;with considerable
dexterity&mdash;away from all roads.</p>

<p>He wandered on and on, becoming hungry, feeling
the gloss go out of his new black suit, and raws<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
develop upon his top-hat as it got knocked against
rocks in some of his falls.</p>

<p>Night set in, and, as Homer says, "all the paths
were darkened"&mdash;but where the tailor found himself
there were no paths to become obscured. He lay in
a bog for some time, unable to extricate himself.
He lost his umbrella, and finally lost his hat. His
imagination conjured up frightful objects; if he did
not lose his courage, it was because, as a tailor, he
had none to lose.</p>

<p>He told me incredible tales of the large, glaring-eyed
monsters that had stared at him as he lay in
the bog. They were probably sheep, but as nine
tailors fled when a snail put out its horns, no wonder
that this solitary member of the profession was
scared at a sheep.</p>

<p>The poor wretch had eaten nothing since the
morning of the preceding day. Happily I had
half a Cornish pasty with me, and I gave it him.
He fell on it ravenously.</p>

<p>Then I showed him the way to the little inn at
Merrivale Bridge, and advised him to hire a trap
there and get back to Plymouth as quickly as
might be.</p>

<p>"I solemnly swear to you, sir," said he, "nothing
will ever induce me to set foot on Dartmoor again.
If I chance to see it from the Hoe, sir, I'll avert
my eyes. How can people think to come here
for pleasure&mdash;for pleasure, sir! But there, Chinamen
eat birds'-nests. There are depraved appetites among
human beings, and only unwholesome-minded individuals
can love Dartmoor."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a story told of one of the nastiest of mires
on Dartmoor, that of Aune Head. A mire, by the
way, is a peculiarly watery bog, that lies at the head
of a river. It is its cradle, and a bog is distributed
indiscriminately anywhere.</p>

<p>A mire cannot always be traversed in safety; much
depends on the season. After a dry summer it is
possible to tread where it would be death in winter
or after a dropping summer.</p>

<p>A man is said to have been making his way
through Aune Mire when he came on a top-hat
reposing, brim downwards, on the sedge. He gave
it a kick, whereupon a voice called out from beneath,
"What be you a-doin' to my 'at?" The man replied,
"Be there now a chap under'n?" "Ees, I reckon,"
was the reply, "and a hoss under me likewise."</p>

<p>There is a track through Aune Head Mire that can
be taken with safety by one who knows it.</p>

<p>Fox Tor Mire once bore a very bad name. The
only convict who really got away from Princetown
and was not recaptured was last seen taking a bee-line
for Fox Tor Mire. The grappling irons at the
disposal of the prison authorities were insufficient
for the search of the whole marshy tract. Since the
mines were started at Whiteworks much has been
done to drain Fox Tor Mire, and to render it safe for
grazing cattle on and about it.</p>

<p>There is a nasty little mire at the head of Redaven
Lake, between West Mill Tor and Yes Tor, and
there is a choice collection of them, inviting the
unwary to their chill embraces, on Cater's Beam,
about the sources of the Plym and Blacklane Brook,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
the ugliest of all occupying a pan and having no
visible outlet. The Redlake mires are also disposed
to be nasty in a wet season, and should be avoided
at all times. Anyone having a fancy to study the
mires and explore them for bog plants will find an
elegant selection around Wild Tor, to be reached by
ascending Taw Marsh and mounting Steeperton Tor,
behind which he will find what he desires.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"On the high tableland," says Mr. William Collier,
"above the slopes, even higher than many tors, are the
great bogs, the sources of the rivers. The great northern
bog is a vast tract of very high land, nothing but bog and
sedge, with ravines down which the feeders of the rivers
pour. Here may be found Cranmere Pool, which is now
no pool at all, but just a small piece of bare black bog.
Writers of Dartmoor guide-books have been pleased
to make much of this Cranmere Pool, greatly to the
advantage of the living guides, who take tourists there
to stare at a small bit of black bog, and leave their
cards in a receptacle provided for them. The large bog
itself is of interest as the source of many rivers; but
there is absolutely no interest in Cranmere Pool, which is
nothing but a delusion and a snare for tourists. It was
a small pool years ago, where the rain water lodged; but
at Okement Head hard by a fox was run to ground, a
terrier was put in, and by digging out the terrier Cranmere
Pool was tapped, and has never been a pool since. So
much for Cranmere Pool!</p>

<p>"This great northern bog, divided into two sections by
Fur Tor and Fur Tor Cut, extends southwards to within
a short distance of Great Mis Tor, and is a vast receptacle
of rain, which it safely holds throughout the driest summer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
Fur Tor Cut is a passage between the north and south parts
of this great bog, evidently cut artificially for a pass for
cattle and men on horseback from Tay Head, or Tavy
Head, to East Dart Head, forming a pass from west to
east over the very wildest part of Dartmoor. Anyone can
walk over the bogs; there is no danger or difficulty to a
man on foot unless he gets exhausted, as some have done.
But horses, bullocks, and sheep cannot cross them. A
man on horseback must take care where he goes, and
this Fur Tor Cut is for his accommodation."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p></div>

<p>The Fur Tor Mire is not composed of black but
of a horrible yellow slime. There is no peat in it,
and to cross it one must leap from one tuft of coarse
grass to another. The "mires" are formed in basins
of the granite, which were originally lakes or tarns,
and into which no streams fall bringing down detritus.
They are slowly and surely filling with vegetable
matter, water-weeds that rot and sink, and as this
vegetable matter accumulates it contracts the area
of the water surface. In the rear of the long sedge
grass or bogbean creeps the heather, and a completely
choked-up mire eventuates in a peat bog.
Granite has a tendency to form saucer-like depressions.
In the Bairischer Wald, the range dividing
Bavaria from Bohemia, are a number of picturesque
tarns, that look as though they occupied the craters
of extinct volcanoes. This, however, is not the case;
the rock is granite, but in this case the lakes are so
deep that they have not as yet been filled with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
vegetable deposit. On the Cornish moors is Dosmare
Pool. This is a genuine instance of the lake
in a granitic district. In Redmoor, near Fox Tor, on
the same moors, we have a similar saucer, with a
granitic lip, over which it discharges its superfluous
water, but it is already so much choked with vegetable
growth as to have become a mire. Ten thousand
years hence it will be a great peat bog.</p>

<p>I had an adventure in Redmoor, and came nearer
looking into the world beyond than has happened
to me before or since. Although it occurred on the
Cornish moors, it might have chanced on Dartmoor,
in one of its mires, for the character of both is the
same, and I was engaged in the same autumn on
both sets of moors. Having been dissatisfied with
the Ordnance maps of the Devon and Cornish moors,
and desiring that certain omissions should be corrected,
I appealed to Sir Charles Wilson, of the
Survey, and he very readily sent me one of his
staff, Mr. Thomas, to go over the ground with me,
and fill in the particulars that deserved to be added.
This was in 1891. The summer had been one of
excessive rain, and the bogs were swollen to bursting.
Mr. Thomas and I had been engaged, on November
5th, about Trewartha Marsh, and as the day closed
in we started for the inhabited land and our lodgings
at "Five Janes." But in the rapidly closing day we
went out of our course, and when nearly dark found
ourselves completely astray, and worst of all in a
bog. We were forced to separate, and make our
way as best we could, leaping from one patch of
rushes or moss to another. All at once I went in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
over my waist, and felt myself being sucked down
as though an octopus had hold of me. I cried out,
but Thomas could neither see me nor assist me had
he been able to approach. Providentially I had a
long bamboo, like an alpenstock, in my hand, and I
laid this horizontally on the surface and struggled
to raise myself by it. After some time, and with
desperate effort, I got myself over the bamboo, and
was finally able to crawl away like a lizard on my
face. My watch was stopped in my waistcoat pocket,
one of my gaiters torn off by the suction of the bog,
and I found that for a moment I had been submerged
even over one shoulder, as it was wet, and the moss
clung to it.</p>

<p>On another occasion I went with two of my
children, on a day when clouds were sweeping across
the moor, over Langstone Moor. I was going to
the collection of hut circles opposite Greenaball, on
the shoulder of Mis Tor. Unhappily, we got into the
bog at the head of Peter Tavy Brook. This is by no
means a dangerous morass, but after a rainy season
it is a nasty one to cross.</p>

<p>Simultaneously down on us came the fog, dense
as cotton wool. For quite half an hour we were
entangled in this absurdly insignificant bog. In getting
about in a mire, the only thing to be done is
to leap from one spot to another where there seems
to be sufficient growth of water-plants and moss
to stay one up. In doing this one loses all idea
of direction, and we were, I have no doubt, forming
figures of eight in our endeavours to extricate ourselves.
I knew that the morass was inconsiderable in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
extent, and that by taking a straight line it would be
easy to get out of it, but in a fog it was not possible
to take a bee-line. Happily, for a moment the
curtain of mist lifted, and I saw on the horizon,
standing up boldly, the stones of the great circle
that is planted on the crest. I at once shouted
to the children to follow me, and in two minutes
we were on solid land.</p>

<p>The Dartmoor bogs may be explored for rare
plants and mosses. The buckbean will be found
and recognised by its three succulent sea-green
leaflets, and by its delicately beautiful white flower
tinged with pink, in June and July. I found it
in 1861 in abundance in Iceland, where it is
called <em>Alptar colavr</em>, the swan's clapper. About
Hamburg it is known as the "flower of liberty,"
and grows only within the domains of the old
Hanseatic Republic. In Iceland it serves a double
purpose. Its thickly interwoven roots are cut and
employed in square pieces like turf or felt as
a protection for the backs of horses that are laden
with packs. Moreover, in crossing a bog, the
clever native ponies always know that they can
tread safely where they see the white flower stand
aloft.</p>

<p>The golden asphodel is common, and remarkably
lovely, with its shades of yellow from the deep-tinted
buds to the paler expanded flower. The
sundew is everywhere that water lodges; the sweet
gale has foliage of a pale yellowish green sprinkled
over with dots, which are resinous glands. The
berries also are sprinkled with the same glands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
The plant has a powerful, but fresh and pleasant,
odour, which insects dislike. Country people were
wont to use sprigs of it, like lavender, to put with
their linen, and to hang boughs above their beds.
The catkins yield a quantity of wax. The sweet
gale was formerly much more abundant, and was
largely employed; it went by the name of the
Devonshire myrtle. When boiled, the wax rises
to the surface of the water. Tapers were made
of it, and were so fragrant while burning, that
they were employed in sick-rooms. In Prussia,
at one time, they were constantly furnished for
the royal household.</p>

<p>The marsh helleborine, <i lang="la">Epipactis palustris</i>, may
be gathered, and the pyramidal orchis, and butterfly
and frog orchises, occasionally.</p>

<p>The furze&mdash;only out of bloom when Love is out
of tune&mdash;keeps away from the standing water. It
is the furze which is the glory of the moor, with
its dazzling gold and its honey breath, fighting for
existence against the farmer who fires it every year,
and envelops Dartmoor in a cloud of smoke from
March to June. Why should he do this instead of
employing the young shoots as fodder?</p>

<p>I think that as Scotland has the thistle, Ireland
the shamrock, and Wales the leek as their emblems,
we Western men of Devon and Cornwall should
adopt the furze. If we want a day, there is that of
our apostle S. Petrock, on June 4th.</p>

<p>By the streams and rivers and on hedge-banks the
yellow broom blazes, yet it cannot rival in intensity
of colour and in variety of tint the magnificent furze<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
or gorse. But the latter is not a pleasant plant to
walk amidst, owing to its prickles, and especial care
must be observed lest it affix one of these in the
knee. The spike rapidly works inwards and produces
intense pain and lameness. The moment it
is felt to be there, the thing to be done is immediately
to extract it with a knife. From the blossoms of
the furze the bees derive their aromatic honey,
which makes that of Dartmoor supreme. Yet beekeeping
is a difficulty there, owing to the gales, that
sweep the busy insects away, so that they fail to
find their direction home. Only in sheltered combes
can they be kept.</p>

<p>The much-relished Swiss honey is a manufactured
product of glycerine and pear-juice; but Dartmoor
honey is the sublimated essence of ambrosial sweetness
in taste and savour, drawn from no other source
than the chalices of the golden furze, and compounded
with no adventitious matter.</p>

<p class="drop-capw"><span class="smcap">Seen</span> from a distance, as for instance from
Winkleigh churchyard, or from Exbourne, Dartmoor
presents a stately appearance, as a ridge of
blue mountains rising boldly against the sky out of
rolling, richly wooded under-land.</p>

<p>But it is only from the north and north-west that it
shows so well. From south and east it has less
dignity of aspect, as the middle distance is made
up of hills, as also because the heights of the
encircling tors are not so considerable, nor is their
outline so bold.</p>

<p>Indeed, the southern edge of Dartmoor is conspicuously
tame. It has no abrupt and rugged
heights, no chasms cleft and yawning in the range,
such as those of the Okement and the Tavy and Taw.
And to the east much high ground is found rising in
stages to the fringe of the heather-clothed tors.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>A TOR, SHOWING WEATHERING OF GRANITE</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>Dartmoor, consisting mainly of a great upheaved
mass of granite, and of a margin of strata that have
been tilted up round it, forms an elevated region some
thirty-two miles from north to south and twenty from
east to west. The heated granite has altered the
slates in contact with it, and is itself broken through
on the west side by an upward gush of molten matter
which has formed Whit Tor and Brent Tor.</p>

<p>The greatest elevations are reached on the outskirts,
and there, also, is the finest scenery. The
interior consists of rolling upland. It has been
likened to a sea after a storm suddenly arrested and
turned to stone; but a still better resemblance, if not
so romantic, is that of a dust-sheet thrown over the
dining-room chairs, the backs of which resemble the
tors divided from one another by easy sweeps of turf.</p>

<p>Most of the heights are crowned with masses of
rock standing up like old castles; these, and these
only, are tors.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Such are the worn-down stumps
of vast masses of mountain formation that have disappeared.
There are no lakes on or about the moor,
but this was not always so. Where is now Bovey
Heathfield was once a noble sheet of water fifty
fathoms deep. Here have been found beds of lignite,
forests that have been overwhelmed by the wash from
the moor, a canoe rudely hollowed out of an oak,
and a curious wooden idol was exhumed leaning
against a trunk of tree that had been swallowed up
in a freshet. The canoe was nine feet long. Bronze
spear-heads have also been found in this ancient
lake, and moulds for casting bronze instruments. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>representation of the idol was given in the <cite>Transactions
of the Devonshire Association</cite> for 1875.</p>

<p>The new Plymouth Reservoir overlies an old lake-bed.
Taw Marsh was also once a sheet of rippling
blue water, but the detritus brought down in the
weathering of what once were real mountains has filled
them all up. Dartmoor at present bears the same
relation to Dartmoor in the far past that the gums
of an old hag bear to the pearly range she wore
when a fresh girl. The granite of Dartmoor was not
well stirred before it was turned out, consequently
it is not homogeneous. Granite is made up of
many materials: hornblende, feldspar, quartz, mica,
schorl, etc. Sometimes we find white mica, sometimes
black. Some granite is red, as at Trowlesworthy,
and the beautiful band that crosses the Tavy
at the Cleave; sometimes pink, as at Leather Tor;
sometimes greenish, as above Okery Bridge; sometimes
pure white, as at Mill Tor.</p>

<p>The granite is of very various consistency, and
this has given it an appearance on the tors as if
it were a sedimentary rock laid in beds. But this
is its little joke to impose on the ignorant. The
feature is due to the unequal hardness of the rock
which causes it to weather in strata.</p>

<p>The fine-grained granite that occurs in dykes is
called elvan, which, if easiest to work, is most liable to
decay. In Cornwall the elvan of Pentewan was used
for the fine church of S. Austell, and as a consequence
the weather has gnawed it away, and the greater part
has had to be renewed. On the other hand, the
splendid elvan of Haute Vienne has supplied the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
cathedral of Limoges with a fine-grained material that
has been carved like lace, and lasts well.</p>

<p>The drift that swept over the land would appear to
have been from west to east, with a trend to the
south, as no granite has been transported, except in
the river-beds to the north or west, whereas blocks
have been conveyed eastward. This is in accordance
with what is shown by the long ridges of clay on the
west of Dartmoor, formed of the rubbing down of
the slaty rocks that lie north and north-west. These
bands all run north and south on the sides of hills,
and in draining processes they have to be pierced
from east to west. This indicates that at some period
during the Glacial Age there was a wash of water
from the north-west over Devon, depositing clay and
transporting granite.</p>

<p>On the sides of the tors are what are locally termed
"clitters" or "clatters" (Welsh <em>clechr</em>), consisting of
a vast quantity of stone strewn in streams from the
tors, spreading out fanlike on the slopes. These are
the wreckage of the tor when far higher than it is
now, <em>i.e.</em> of the harder portions that have not been
dissolved and swept away.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The tors&mdash;Nature's towers&mdash;are huge masses of granite
on the top of the hills, which are not high enough to
be called mountains, piled one upon another in Nature's
own fantastic way. There may be a tor, or a group of tors,
crowning an eminence, but the effect, either near or afar, is
to give the hilltop a grand and imposing look. These
large blocks of granite, poised on one another, some
appearing as if they must fall, others piled with curious
regularity&mdash;considering they are Nature's work&mdash;are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
prominent features in a Dartmoor landscape, and, wild as
parts of Dartmoor are, the tors add a notable picturesque
effect to the scene. There are very fine tors on the western
side of the moor. Those on the east and south are not so
fine as those on the north and west. In the centre of the
moor there are also fine tors. They are, in fact, very numerous,
for nearly every little hill has its granite cap, which is
a tor, and every tor has its name. Some of the high hills
that are tor-less are called beacons, and were doubtless used
as signal beacons in times gone by. As the tors are not
grouped or built with any design by Nature to attract the
eye of man, they are the more attractive on that account,
and one of their consequent peculiarities is that from different
points of view they never appear the same. There can
be no sameness in a landscape of tors when every tor
changes its features according to the point of view from
which you look at it. Every tor also has its heap of rock
at its feet, some of them very striking jumbles of blocks of
granite scattered in great confusion between the tor and the
foot of the hill. Fur Tor, which is in the very wildest spot
on Dartmoor, and is one of the leading tors, has a <em>clitter</em> of
rocks on its western side as remarkable as the tor itself;
Mis Tor, also on its western side, has a very fine clitter
of granite; Leather Tor stands on the top of a mass of
granite rocks on its east and south sides; and Hen Tor, on
the south quarter, is surrounded with blocks of granite, with
a hollow like the crater of a volcano, as if they had been
thrown up by a great convulsion of Nature. Hen Tor is
remarkable chiefly for this wonderful mass of granite blocks
strewn around it. All the moor has granite boulders
scattered about, but they accumulate at the feet of the tors
as if for their support."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>Here among the clitters, where they form caves,
a search may be made for the beautiful moss
<i lang="la">Schistostega osmundacea</i>. It has a metallic lustre
like green gold, and on entering a dark place under
rocks, the ground seems to be blazing with gold.
In Germany the Fichtel Gebirge are of granite,
and the Luchsen Berg is so called because there
in the hollow under the rocks grew abundance of
the moss glittering like the eyes of a lynx. The
authorities of Alexanderbad have had to rail in
the grottoes to prevent the <em>gold moss</em> from being
carried off by the curious. Murray says of these
retreats of the luminous moss:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The wonder of the place is the beautiful phosphorescence
which is seen in the crannies of the rocks, and
which appears and disappears according to the position
of the spectator. This it is which has given rise to
the fairy tales of gold and gems with which the gnomes
and cobolds tantalise the poor peasants. The light
resembles that of glow-worms; or, if compared to a
precious stone, it is something between a chrysolite and
a cat's-eye, but shining with a more metallic lustre. On
picking up some of it, and bringing it to the light, nothing
is found but dirt."</p></div>

<p>Professor Lloyd found that the luminous appearance
was due to the presence of small crystals in the
structure which reflect the light. Coleridge says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Tis said in Summer's evening hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flashes the golden-coloured flower,<br /></span>
<span class="i10">A fair electric light."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>
<p>In 1843, when the luminosity of plants was
recorded in the <cite>Proceedings of the British Association</cite>,
Mr. Babington mentioned having seen in the
south of England a peculiar bright appearance
produced by the presence of the <i lang="la">Schistostega pennata</i>,
a little moss which inhabited caverns and dark
places: but this was objected to on the ground
that the plant reflected light, and did not give it
off in phosphorescence.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>When lighted on, it has the appearance of a
handful of emeralds or aqua marine thrown into
a dark hole, and is frequently associated with the
bright green liverwort. Parfitt, in his <cite>Moss Flora
of Devon</cite>, gives it as <em>osmundacea</em>, not as <em>pennata</em>.
It was first discovered in Britain by a Mr. Newberry,
on the road from Zeal to South Tawton; it is, however,
to be found in a good many places, as Hound
Tor, Widdecombe, Leather Tor, and in the Swincombe
valley, also in a cave under Lynx Tor. If
found, please to leave alone. Gathered it is invisible;
the hand or knife brings away only mud.</p>

<p>But what all are welcome to go after is that which
is abundant on every moorside&mdash;but nowhere finer
than on such as have not been subjected to periodical
"swaling" or burning. I refer to the whortleberry.
This delicious fruit, eaten with Devonshire cream,
is indeed a delicacy. A gentleman from London
was visiting me one day. As he was fond of good
things, I gave him whortleberry and cream. He
ate it in dead silence, then leaned back in his chair,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
looked at me with eyes full of feeling, and said, "I
am thankful that I have lived to this day."</p>

<p>The whortleberry is a good deal used in the south
of France for the adulteration and colouring of claret,
whole truck-loads being imported from Germany.</p>

<p>There is an interesting usage in my parish, and I
presume the same exists in others. On one day in
summer, when the "whorts" are ripe, the mothers
unite to hire waggons of the farmers, or borrow
them, and go forth with their little ones to the
moor. They spend the day gathering the berries,
and light their fires, form their camp, and have their
meals together, returning late in the evening, very
sunburnt, with very purple mouths, very tired maybe,
but vastly happy, and with sufficient fruit to sell
to pay all expenses and leave something over.</p>

<p>If the reader would know what minerals are found
on Dartmoor he must go elsewhere.</p>

<p>I have a list before me that begins thus: "Allophane,
actinolite, achroite, andalusite, <em>apatite</em>"&mdash;but
I can copy out no more. I have often found
<em>appetite</em> on Dartmoor, but have not the slightest
suspicion as to what is apatite. The list winds
up with wolfram, about which I can say something.
Wolfram is a mineral very generally found along
with tin, and that is just the "cussedness" of it,
for it spoils tin.</p>

<p>When tin ore is melted at a good peat fire, out
runs a silver streak of metal. This is brittle as
glass, because of the wolfram in it. To get rid of
the wolfram the whole has to be roasted, and the
operation is delicate, and must have bothered our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
forefathers considerably. By means of this second
process the wolfram, or tungsten as it is also called,
is got rid of.</p>

<p>Now, it is a curious fact that the tin of Dartmoor
is of extraordinary purity; it has little or none of
this abominable wolfram associated with it, so that
it is by no means improbable that the value of tin
as a metal was discovered on Dartmoor, or in some
as yet unknown region where it is equally unalloyed.</p>

<p>In Cornwall all the tin is mixed with tungsten.
Now this material has been hitherto regarded as
worthless; it has been sworn at by successive generations
of miners since mining first began. But all
at once it has leaped into importance, for it has
been discovered to possess a remarkable property
of hardening iron, and is now largely employed for
armour-plated vessels. From being worth nothing
it has risen to a rapidly rising value, as we are
becoming aware that we shall have to present impenetrable
sides to our Continental neighbours.</p>

<p>Dartmoor comprises the "forest" and the surrounding
commons, as extensive together as the forest itself.
"What have you got on you, little girl?" asked
a good woman of a shivering child. "Please, mem,
first there's a jacket, then a gownd, and then comes
Oi." So with Dartmoor. First come the venville
parishes, next their extensive commons, and "then
comes Oi," the forest itself.</p>

<p>The venville parishes are all moorland parishes&mdash;Belstone,
Throwleigh, Gidleigh, Chagford, North
Bovey, Manaton, Widdecombe, Holne, Buckfastleigh,
Dean Prior, South Brent, Shaugh, Meavy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
Sheeps Tor, Walkhampton, Sampford Spiney, Whitchurch,
Peter Tavy, Lydford, Bridestowe, Sourton.
There are others, standing like the angel of the
Apocalypse, with one foot on the moorland, the
other steeped in the green waves of foliage of the
lowlands; such are South Tawton, Cornwood, and
Tavistock. Others, again, as Lustleigh, Bridford,
Moreton, Buckland-in-the-Moor, Ilsington, and Ugborough,
must surely have been moorland settlements
at one time, and Okehampton itself is as distinctly
a moor town as is Moreton, which tells its
own tale in its name. But all these have their warm
envelope of arable land, groves and woods, farms
and hamlets. Such have their commons, over which
every householder has a right to send cattle, to take
turf and stone, and, alas! with the connivance of the
other householders, to inclose. This inclosing has
been going on at a great rate in some of the parishes.
For instance, common rights are exercised by the
householders of South Zeal over an immense tract
of land on the north side of Cosdon. Of late years
they have put their heads together and decided, as
they are few in number, to appropriate it to themselves
as private property, and inclosures have proceeded
at a rapid rate.</p>

<p>In Bridestowe there is a tract of open land on
which the poor cotters have, from time immemorial,
kept their cows. But they are tenants, and not householders,
and have consequently no rights. The seven
or eight owners have combined to inclose and sell or
let for building purposes all that tract of moor, and
the cotters have lost their privilege of keeping cows.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
What we see now going on under our eyes has been
going on from time immemorial. Parishes have encroached,
and the genuine forest has shrunk together
before them. The commons still exist, and are extensive,
but they are being gradually and surely
reduced. "Then comes Oi!" Look at the map
and see of what the forest really consists. It surely
must have been larger formerly.</p>

<p>On the forest itself are a certain number of
"ancient tenements," thirty-five in all. These are
of remote antiquity. On certainly most of them,
probably on all, the plough and the hoe turn up
numerous flint tools, weapons, and chips&mdash;sure proof
that they were settlements in prehistoric times.
These tenements are at Brimpts, Hexworthy,
Huccaby, Bellever, Dunnabridge, Baberry, Pizwell,
Runnage, Sherberton, Riddons, Merripit, Hartland,
Broom Park, Brown Berry, and Prince Hall. These
were held&mdash;and some still are&mdash;by copy of the
Court Roll, and the holders are bound to do suit
and service at the Court. It is customary for every
holder on accession to the holding to inclose a tract
of a hundred acres, and this inclosure constitutes his
newtake.</p>

<p>The forest belongs to the Prince of Wales, but I
believe has never been visited by him. Were he to
do so, he would be surprised, and perhaps not a little
indignant, to see how his tenants are housed. A
forest does not necessarily signify a wood. It is a
place for wild beasts. The origin of the word is not
very clear. Lindwode says, "A Forest is a place
where are wild beasts; whereas a Park is a place
where they are shut in." Ockam says, "A Forest is
a safe abode for wild beasts," and derives the word
from <em>feresta</em>, <em>i.e.</em> a place for wild creatures. It was, in
fact, a tract of uninclosed land reserved for the king
to hunt in, and a <em>chase</em> was a similar tract reserved by
the lord of the manor for his own hunting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>It is more than doubtful whether Dartmoor was
ever covered with trees. No doubt there have been
trees in the bottoms, and indeed oak has been
taken from some of the bogs; but the charcoal found
in the fire-pits of the primitive inhabitants of the
moor in the Bronze Age shows that, even in the prehistoric
period, the principal wood was alder, and that
such oak as there was did not grow to a large size,
and was mainly confined to the valleys that opened
out of the moor into the lowlands. Up these, doubtless,
the forest crept. Elsewhere there may have
been clusters of stunted trees, of which the only
relics are Piles and Wistman's Wood. There were
some very fine oaks at Brimpts, and also in Okehampton
Park, but these were cut down during the
European war with Napoleon. After the wood at
Brimpts had fallen under the axe, it was found that
the cost of carriage would be so great that the timber
was sold for a mere trifle, only sufficient to pay for
the labour of cutting it down.</p>

<p>The forest is divided into four quarters, in each of
which, except the western, is a pound for stray
cattle. Formerly the Forest Reeve privately communicated
with the venville men when he had fixed
a day for a "drift," which was always some time
about midsummer. Then early in the morning all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
assembled mounted. A horn was blown through
a holed stone set up on a height, and the drift began.
Cattle or horses were driven to a certain point, at
which stood an officer of the Duchy on a stone, and
read a proclamation, after which the owners were
called to claim their cattle or ponies. Venville
tenants removed them without paying any fine, but
all others were pounded, and their owners could not
recover them without payment of a fine.</p>

<p>The Duchy Pound is at Dunnabridge, where is
a curious old seat within the inclosure for the
adjudicator of fines and costs. It is apparently a
cromlech that has been removed or adapted. The
Duchy now lets the quarters to the moormen, who
charge a small fee for every sheep, bullock, or
horse turned out on the moor not belonging to a
venville man, and for this fee they accord it their
protection.</p>

<p>A good deal of money has been expended on
the reclaiming of Dartmoor. Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt,
Usher of the Black Rod, was Warden of the Stannary
and Steward of the Forest for George IV. when
Prince of Wales. He fondly supposed that he had
discovered an uncultivated land, which needed only
the plough and some lime to make its virgin soil
productive. He induced others to embark on the
venture. Swincombe and Stannon were started to
become fine farm estates. Great entrance gates were
erected to where mansions were proposed to be built.
But those who had leased these lands found that the
draining of the bogs drained their pockets much
faster than the mires, and abandoned the attempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
which had ruined them. Others followed. Prince's
Hall was rebuilt with fine farm buildings by a Mr.
Fowler from the north of England, who expended
his fortune there and left a disappointed man.
Before him Sir Francis Buller, who had bought
Prince's Hall, planted there forty thousand trees&mdash;such
as are not dead are distorted starvelings. Mr.
Bennett built Archerton, near Post Bridge, and inclosed
thousands of acres. He cannot have recovered
a sum approaching his outlay in the sixty years of
his tenancy. The fact is that Dartmoor is cut out
by Nature to be a pasturage for horses, cattle, and
sheep in the summer months, and for that only.
In the burning and dry summers of 1893, 1897, and
1899 tens of thousands of cattle were sent there,
even from so far off as Kent, where water and
pasturage were scarce, and on the moor they both
are ever abundant.</p>

<p>Tenements there must be, but they should be
in the sheltered valleys, and the wide hillsides and
sweeps of moor should be left severely alone. As
it is, encroachments have gone on unchecked, rather
have been encouraged. Every parish in Devon has
a right to send cattle to the moor, excepting only
Barnstaple and Totnes. But the Duchy, by allowing
and favouring inclosures, is able to turn common
land into private property, and that it is only too
willing to do.</p>

<p>Happily there now exists a Dartmoor Preservation
Society, which is ready to contest every attempt
made in this direction. But it can do very little to
protect the commons around the forest&mdash;in fact it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
can do nothing, if the freeholders in the parishes that
enjoy common rights agree together to appropriate
the land to themselves&mdash;and for the poor labourer
who is able to buy himself a cow it can do nothing
at all, for his rights have no legal force.</p>

<p class="drop-capw"><span class="smcap">Probably</span> no other tract of land of the same
extent in England contains such numerous and
well-preserved remains of prehistoric antiquity as
Dartmoor.</p>

<p>The curious feature about them is that they all
belong to one period, that of the Early Bronze, when
flint was used abundantly, but metal was known,
and bronze was costly and valued as gold is now.</p>

<p>Not a trace has been found so far of the peoples
who intervened between these primitive occupants
and the mediæval tin-miners.</p>

<p>If iron was introduced a couple of centuries before
the Christian era, how is it that the British inhabitants
who used iron and had it in abundance have left
no mark of their occupancy of Dartmoor? It can
be accounted for only on the supposition that they
did not value it. The woods had been thinned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
and they preferred the lowlands, whereas in the
earlier period the dense forests that clothed the
country were too close a jungle and too much infested
by wolves to be suitable for the habitation of a
pastoral people.</p>

<p>That under the Roman domination the tin was
worked on the moor there is no evidence to show.
No Roman coins have been found there except
a couple brought by French prisoners to Princetown.</p>

<p>It may be said that iron would corrode and
disappear, whereas flint is imperishable, and bronze
nearly so. But where is Roman pottery? Where
is even the pottery of the Celtic period? An era
is distinguished by its fictile ware. A huge gap in
historic continuity is apparent. All the earthenware
found on Dartmoor is either prehistoric or mediæval,
probably even so late as the reign of Elizabeth.</p>

<p>No indication is found that the Saxons worked the
tin or even drove their cattle on to the moor. In
Domesday Book Dartmoor is not even mentioned.
It is hard to escape the conclusion that from the
close of the prehistoric period to that of our Plantagenet
kings, Dartmoor was avoided as a waste,
inhospitable region.</p>

<p>Of man in the earliest period at which he is known
to have existed&mdash;the so-called Palæolithic man&mdash;not
a trace has been found on Dartmoor. Probably when
he lived in Britain the whole upland was clothed in
snow. He has left his tools in the Brixham and
Torquay caves&mdash;none in the bogs of the moor.
Indeed, when these bogs have been dug into, there
are not the smallest indications found of man having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
visited the moor before the advent of what is called
the Neolithic Age.</p>

<p>About the man of this period I must say something,
as he in his day lived in countless swarms on
this elevated land. He may have lived also in the
valleys of the lowlands, but his traces there have
been obliterated by the plough. First of all as to
his personal appearance. He was dark-haired, tall,
and his head was long, like that of a new-born child,
or boat-shaped, a form that disappears with civilisation,
and resolves itself into the long face instead of
the long head.</p>

<p>At some period, vastly remote, a great migration
of a long-headed race took place from Central Asia.
It went forth in many streams. One to the east
entered Japan; probably the Chinese and Anamese
represent another. But we are mainly concerned
with the western outpour. It traversed Syria, and
Gilead and Moab are strewn with its remains, hut
circles, dolmens, and menhirs identical with those
on Dartmoor. Hence one branch passed into Arabia,
where, to his astonishment, Mr. Palgrave lighted on
replicas of Stonehenge.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>Another branch threw itself over the Himalayas,
and covered India with identical monuments. Again
another turned west; it traversed the Caspian and
left innumerable traces along the northern slopes of
the Caucasus. The Kuban valley is crowded with
their dolmens. They occupied the Crimea, and then
struck for the Baltic. That a branch had passed
through Asia Minor and Greece, and constituted
itself as the Etruscan power in Italy, is probable but
not established. The northern stream strewed Mecklenburg
and Hanover with its remains, occupied
Denmark and Lower Sweden, crossed into Britain,
and took complete possession of the British Isles.
Other members of the same swarm skirted the
Channel and crowded the plateaux and moors of
Western and Central France with their megalithic
remains. The same people occupied Spain and
Portugal, the Balearic Isles, Corsica and Sardinia,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>and Northern Africa, and are now represented by
the Koumirs and Kabyles. To this race the name
of Iberian, Ivernian, or Silurian has been given. It
contributed its name to Ireland (Erin or <em>Ierne</em>), where
it maintained itself, but was known to the conquering
Gaels as the Tuatha da Danann and Firbolgs, two
branches of the same stock. The name of Damnonia
given to Devon is probably due to these same
Danann, who were also found in the south of Scotland.
When this great people reached Europe, Japan,
India, Africa, before its branches had begun to ramify
to east and west, to south and north, its religious
doctrines and its practices had become stereotyped,
and almost ineradicably ingrained into the consciousness
of the entire stock.</p>

<p>If we desire to understand what their peculiar
views were, what were the dominant ideas which
directed their conduct, and which led them to erect
the monuments which are marvels to us, even at the
present day, we must go to China.</p>

<p>Let us look for a moment into China at the present
day. At first sight, the Chinese strike us as being
not only geographically our antipodes, but as being
our opposites in every particular&mdash;mental, moral,
social; in language as in ideas.</p>

<p>The Chinese language is without an alphabet and
without a grammar. It is made up of monosyllables
that acquire their significance by the position in
which they are placed in a sentence. In customs
the Chinese differ from us as much. In mourning
they wear white; a Chinese dinner begins with the
dessert and ends with the soup; a scholar, to recite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
his lessons, turns his back on the teacher. But it
is chiefly in the way in which the living and the
dead are regarded as forming an indissoluble
commonwealth, that the difference of ideas is most
pronounced. Regard for the dead is the first obligation
to a Chinese. A man of the people who
is ennobled, ennobles, not his descendants, but his
ancestry. The duty of the eldest son of the family
is to maintain the worship of the ancestors. Denial
of a sepulchre is the most awful punishment that
can be inflicted; a Chinese will cheerfully commit
suicide to gain a suitable tomb and cult after death.
The most sacred spot on earth is the mausoleum,
and that is perpetually inviolable. Consequently, if
this principle could be carried out to the letter, the
earth would be transformed into one vast necropolis,
from the occupation of which the living would be
in time entirely excluded. It is this respect for
graves which stands in the way of the execution
of works of public utility, such as canals and
railroads; and it is the imperious obligation of
maintaining the worship of ancestors that blocks conversion
to Christianity. It is resentment against lack
of respect shown to the dead, neglect of duty to the
dead, which has provoked the massacres of Christians.
A Chinese, under certain circumstances, is justified
in strangling his father, but not in omitting to worship
him after he has throttled him.</p>

<p>On the great Thibet plateau, geographically contiguous
to the Chinese, and under the Empire of
China, the Mongol nomads are so absolutely devoid
of a grain of respect for their dead, that, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
the smallest scruple, they leave the corpses of their
parents and children on the face of the desert, to be
devoured by dogs and preyed on by vultures.</p>

<p>If we look at the Nile valley we see that the
ancient Egyptians were dominated by the same
ideas as the Chinese. To them the tomb was the
habitation <i lang="fr">par excellence</i> of the family. Of the
dwelling-houses of the old Egyptians the remains
are comparatively mean, but their mausoleums are
palatial. The house for the living was but as a
tent, to be removed; but the mansion of the dead
was a dwelling-place for ever.</p>

<p>Not only so, but just as the ancient Egyptian
supposed that the <em>Ka</em>, the soul, or one of the souls
of the deceased, occupied the monument, tablet, or
obelisk set up in memorial of the dead, so does the
Chinese now hold that a soul, or emanation from
the dead, enters into and dwells in the memorial
set up, apart from the tomb, to his honour.</p>

<p>Now if we desire to discover what was the distinguishing
motive in life of the long-headed Neolithic
man, we shall find it in his respect for the dead; and
he has stamped his mark everywhere where he has
been by the stupendous tombs he has erected, at
vast labour, out of unwrought stones. He cannot
be better described than as the dolmen-builder; that
is to say, the man who erected the family or tribal
ossuaries that remain in such numbers wherever he
has planted his foot.</p>

<p>In China, it is true, there are no dolmens, but for
this there is a reason. Before the descendants of the
Hundred Families who entered the Celestial Empire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
had reached and obtained possession of mountains
whence stone could be quarried, many centuries
elapsed, and forced the Chinese to make shift with
other material than stone, and so formed their habit
of entombment without stone; but the frame of
mind which, in a rocky land, would have prompted
them to set up dolmens remained unchanged, and so
remains to the present day.</p>

<p>The exploration of dolmens in Europe reveals that
they were family or tribal burial-places, and were
used for a long continuance of time. The dead to
be laid in them were occasionally brought from a
distance, as the bones show indication of having
been cleaned of the flesh with flint scrapers, and
to have been rearranged in an irregular and unscientific
manner, a left leg being sometimes applied
to a right thigh; or it may be that on the anniversary
of an interment the bones of the deceased were
taken out, scraped and cleaned, and then replaced.</p>

<p>In Algeria, and on the edge of the Sahara, are
found great trilithons, that is to say, two huge upright
stones, with one laid across at the top, forming
doorways leading to nothing, but similar to those
which are found at Stonehenge.</p>

<p>What was this significance?</p>

<p>We turn to the Chinese for an explanation, and
find that to this day they erect triumphal gates&mdash;not
now of stone, but of wood&mdash;in memory of and in
honour of such widows as commit suicide so as to join
their dear departed husbands in the world of spirits.
On the other hand, our widows forget us and remarry.</p>

<p>(Actual size.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>The dolmen-builders were people with flocks and
herds, and who cultivated grain and spun yarn.
Their characteristic implement is the so-called celt,
in reality an axe, sometimes perforated for the reception
of a handle, most commonly not. The
perforation belongs to the latest stage of Neolithic
civilisation. Their weapons, or tools, were first
ground. In about a score of places in France polishing
rocks exist, marked with the furrows made by
the axe when worked to and fro upon them, and
others that are smaller have been removed to
museums. At Stoney-Kirk, in Wigtownshire, a
grinding-stone of red sandstone, considerably hollowed
by use, was found with a small, unfinished
axe of Silurian schist lying upon it. In the recent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
exploration of hut circles at Legis Tor a grindstone
was found in one of the habitations, and on it an
incomplete tool that was abandoned there before
it was finished.</p>

<p>After grinding, these implements underwent laborious
polishing by friction with the hand or with
leather.</p>

<p>At the same time that these artificially smoothed
tools were fabricated, flint was used, beautifully
chipped and flaked, to form arrow and spear heads
and swords. The arrow-heads are either leaf-shaped
or tanged.</p>

<p>The pottery of the dolmen-builders is very rude.
It is made of clay mingled with coarse fragments
of stone or shell, is very thick and badly tempered;
it is hand-made, and seems hardly capable of enduring
exposure to a brisk fire. The vessels have usually
broad mouths, with an overhanging rim like a turned-back
glove-cuff, and below this the vessel rapidly
slopes away. The ornamentation is constant everywhere.
It consisted of zigzags, chevrons, depressions
made by twisted cord, and finger-nail marks in rings
round the bowls or rims. It was not till late in the
Bronze Age that circles and spirals were adopted.</p>

<p>Celtic ornamentation is altogether different.</p>

<p>Whilst the long-headed dolmen-builder crept along
the coast of Europe, there was growing up among
the mountains and lakes of Central Europe a hardy
round-headed race&mdash;the Aryan, destined to be his
master. Was it through instinct of what was to be,
that the Ivernian shrank from penetrating into the
heart of the Continent, and clung to the seaboard?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>When the dolmen-builder arrived in Britain, to
the best of our knowledge, he found no one there.
On the Continent, on the other hand, if he went
far inland, he not only clashed with the Aryan
round-heads, but also here and there stumbled on
the lingering remains of the primeval Palæolithic
people, who have left their remains in England in
the river-drift, and in Devon in the Brixham caves
and Kent's Hole.</p>

<p>The dolmen-builder has persisted in asserting
himself. Though cranial modifications have taken
place, the dusky skin, and the dark eyes and hair
and somewhat squat build, have remained in the
Western Isles, in Western Ireland, in Wales, and in
Cornwall. It is still represented in Brittany. It is
predominant in South-Western France, and is typical
in Portugal.</p>

<p>After a lapse of time, of what duration we know
not, a great wave of Aryans poured from the
mountains of Central Europe, and, traversing Britain,
occupied Ireland. This was the Gael. This people
subjugated the Ivernian inhabitants, and rapidly
mixed with them, imposing on them their tongue,
except in South Wales, where the Silurian was
found to have retained his individuality when conquered
by Agricola in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 78. But if the Gaelic
invaders subjugated the Ivernians, they were in turn
conquered by them, though in a different manner.
The strongly marked religious ideas of the long-headed
men, and their deeply rooted habit of
worship of ancestors, impressed and captured the
imagination of their masters, and as the races<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
became fused, the mixed race continued to build
dolmens and erect other megalithic monuments once
characteristic of the long-heads, often on a larger
scale than before. Stonehenge and Avebury were
erections of the Bronze Period, and late in it, and of
the composite people.</p>

<p>If we look at the physique of the two races, we
find a great difference between them. The Ivernian
was short in stature, with a face mild in expression,
oval, without high cheek-bones, and without strongly
characterised supraciliary ridges. The women were
all conspicuously smaller than the men, and of
markedly inferior development. The conquering
race was other. The lower jaw was massive and
square at the chin, the molar bones prominent,
and the brows heavy. The head was remarkably
short, and the face expressed vigour, was coarse,
and the aspect threatening. Moreover, the women
were as fully developed as the men, so much so that
where all the bones are not present it is not always
easy to distinguish the sex of a skeleton of this race.
What Tacitus says of the German women&mdash;that they
are almost equal to the men both in strength and in
size&mdash;applies also to these round-headed invaders of
Britain; and, indeed, what we are assured of the
Britons in the time of Boadicea, that it was <i lang="la">solitum
feminarum ductu bellare</i>, shows us that the same
masculine character belonged to the women of
British origin. The average difference in civilised
races in the stature of men and women at present
is about four inches, but twice this difference is
very usually found to exist between the male and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
female skeletons of the Polished Stone Period in
the long barrows. The difference is even more
strikingly shown by a comparison of the male and
female collar-bones; and we are able to reproduce
from them in picture the Neolithic woman of the
Ivernian race, with narrow chest and drooping
shoulders, utterly unlike the muscular and vigorous
Gaelic women who were true consorts to their men
when they came over to conquer the island of Britain.</p>

<p>After a lapse of time the long-head began to reassert
itself, and the infusion of its blood into the
veins of the dominant race led to great modification
of its harshness of feature. When iron was
introduced into Britain, whether by peaceable means
or whether by the second Aryan invasion, that of
the Cymri or Britons, we do not know, but when
Cæsar landed in Britain, <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 55, he found that iron
was in general use.</p>

<p>The second Aryan invasion alluded to was that of
the true Britons. They also came from the Alps,
where they had lived on platforms constructed on the
lakes. They occupied the whole of Britain proper,
but not Scotland, and made but attempts to effect
a landing in Ireland.</p>

<p>They were entirely out of sympathy with the
original race and its ideas, and did not assimilate
their religion and adopt their practices as had the
Gaels.</p>

<p>The distinction between the two branches of the
great Celtic family is mainly linguistic. Where the
British employed the letter <em>p</em>, the Gael used the
hard <em>c</em>, pronounced like <em>k</em>. For instance, <em>Pen</em>, a head,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
in British, is <em>Cen</em> in Gaelic; and we can roughly tell
where the population was British by noticing the
place names, such as those beginning with Pen.
When these were Gaels, the same headlands would
begin with Cen.</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"By Tre, Pol, and Pen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You know the names of Cornishmen,"<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>and this at once decides that the inhabitants of the
western peninsula were not Gaels.</p>

<p>From the lakes of Switzerland the Britons had
brought with them their great aptitude for wattle-work.
They built their houses and halls, not of
stone, but of woven withies. Cæsar says that they
were wont to erect enormous basket-work figures,
fill them with human victims, and burn the whole as
sacrifices to their gods. It is a curious coincidence
that on some of the old Celtic crosses are found
carved imitations of men made of wicker-work.
These represent saints made of the same material
and in the same manner by the same people, after
they had embraced Christianity and abandoned
human sacrifices.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Let us try to imagine what was the mode of life
of those people who raised their monuments on
Dartmoor. They were pastoral, but they also
certainly had some knowledge of tillage. In certain
lights, hillsides on the moor show indications of
having been cultivated in ridges, and this not with
the plough, but with the spade. We cannot say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
that these belong to the early population, but as
they are found near their settlements it is possible
that they may be traces of original cultivation.
But we know from the remains of grain found
in the habitations and tombs of the same people
in limestone districts that they were acquainted with
cereals, and their grindstones have been found on
Dartmoor in their huts.</p>

<p>Still, grain was not the main element of their diet;
they lived chiefly on milk and flesh. In the huts
have been found broad vessels that were covered
with round discs of slate, and it is probable that
these were receptacles for milk or butter, but the
milk would mainly be contained in wooden or
leathern vessels. Elsewhere their spindle-whorls
have been found in fair abundance; not so on Dartmoor&mdash;as
yet only two have been recovered. This
shows that little spinning was done, and no weights
such as are used by weavers have been found. The
early occupants were in the main clothed in skins.</p>

<p>Their huts were circular, of stone, with very
frequently a shelter wall, opposed to the prevailing
south-west wind, screening the door, which opened
invariably to the south or south-west. The whole
was roofed over by poles planted on the walls,
brought together in the middle, and thatched over
with rushes or heather. The walls were rarely above
four feet six inches high. They are lined within
with large stones, set up on end, their smooth
surfaces inwards, and the stone walls were backed
up with turf without, making of the huts green
mounds. This gave occasion to the fairy legends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
of the Celts, who represented the earlier population
as living in mounds, which the Irish called <em>sidi</em>, and
the people occupying them the Tuatha da Danann.
As already said, this same name meets us in Damnonii,
the oldest appellation for the people of Devon. They
were a sociable people, clustering together for mutual
protection in <em>pounds</em>.</p>

<p>These pounds are large circular inclosures, the walls
probably only about four feet high, but above this
was a breastwork of turf or palisading. Outside the
pound were huts, perhaps of guards keeping watch.</p>

<p>Many of the huts have paddocks connected with
them, as though these latter had been kail gardens,
but some of these paddocks are large enough to
have been tilled for corn. Their plough, if they used
one, was no more than a crooked beam, drawn by
oxen. It is possible that the numerous sharp flakes
of flint that are found were employed fastened into
a sort of harrow, as teeth. Their cooking was done
either in pots sunk in the soil, or in holes lined
with stones.</p>

<p>Rounded pebbles, water-worn, were amassed, and
baked hot in the fire, then rolled to the "cooking-hole,"
in which was the meat, and layers of hot
stones and meat alternated, till the hollow receptacle
was full, and the whole was then covered with sods
till the flesh was cooked.</p>

<p>The following account of the manner in which the
Fiana, the Irish militia, did their cooking in pre-Christian
times will illustrate this custom:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"When they had success in hunting, it was their custom
in the forenoon to send their huntsman, with what they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
had killed, to a proper place, where there was plenty of
wood and water; there they kindled great fires, into which,
their way was, to throw a number of stones, where they
continued till they were red hot; then they applied themselves
to dig two great pits in the earth, into one of which,
upon the bottom, they were wont to lay some of these hot
stones as a pavement, upon them they would place the
raw flesh, bound up hard in green sedge or bulrushes;
over these bundles was fixed another layer of hot stones,
then a quantity of flesh, and this method was observed till
the pit was full. In this manner their flesh was sodden or
stewed till it was fit to eat, and then they uncovered it;
and, when the hole was emptied, they began their meal."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p></div>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>
<p>Some of the huts are very large, and in these no
traces of fires and no cooking-holes have been found.
Adjoining them, however, are smaller huts that are so
full of charcoal and peat ash and fragments of pottery
that no doubt can be entertained that these were the
kitchens, and the large huts were summer habitations.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/p046.jpg" width="700" height="476" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>COOKING-POT.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Occasionally a small hut has been found with a
large hole in the centre crammed with ashes and
round stones, the hole out of all proportion to the
size of the hut if considered as a habitation. No
reasonable doubt can be entertained that these were
bath huts. The Lapps still employ the sweating-houses.
They pour water over hot stones, and the
steam makes them perspire profusely, whereupon
they shampoo themselves or rub each other down
with birch twigs.</p>

<p>Indeed, men wearing skin dresses are obliged to go
through some such a process to keep their pores in
healthy action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>It is very probable that the long tracklines that
extend over hill and vale on Dartmoor indicate tribal
boundaries, limits beyond which the cattle of one
clan might not feed. Some of these lines, certainly
of the age of the Neolithic men of the hut circles,
may be traced for miles. There is one that starts
apparently from the Plym at Trowlesworthy Warren,
where are clusters of huts and inclosures. It follows
the contour of the hills to Pen Beacon, where it
curves around a collection of huts and strikes for
the source of the Yealm by two pounds containing
huts. That it went further is probable, but recent
inclosures have led to its destruction. We cannot be
sure of the age of these tracklines unless associated
with habitations, as some very similar have been
erected in recent times as reeves delimiting mining
rights.</p>

<p>That the occupants of the moor at this remote
period loved to play at games is shown by the
numbers of little round pebbles, carefully selected,
some for their bright colours, that have been found
on the floors of their huts. That they used divination
by the crystal is shown by clear quartz prisms
having been discovered tolerably frequently. These
are still employed among the Australian natives for
seeing spirits and reading the future.</p>

<p>That these early people were monogamists is probable
from the small size of their huts; they really
could not have accommodated more than one wife
and her little family.</p>

<p>That they were a gentle, peaceable people is also
apparent from the rarity of weapons of war. Plenty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
flint scrapers are found for cleaning the hides, plenty
of rubber-stones for smoothing seams, plenty of small
knives for cutting up meat, but hardly a spear-head,
and arrow-heads are comparatively scarce. Their
most formidable camp is at Whit Tor, the soil of
which is littered with flint chips. It did not, on
exploration, yield a single arrow-head. The pounds
were inclosed to protect the sheep and young cattle
against wolves, not to save the scalps of their owners
from the tomahawks of their fellow-men.</p>

<p>With regard to the numbers of people who lived
on Dartmoor in prehistoric times, it is simply
amazing to reflect upon. Tens of thousands of
their habitations have been destroyed; their largest
and most populous settlements, where are now the
"ancient tenements," have been obliterated, yet tens
of thousands remain. At Post Bridge, within a
radius of half a mile, are fifteen pounds. If we
give an average of twenty huts to a pound, and
allow for habitations scattered about, not inclosed
in a pound, and give six persons to a hut, we have
at once a population, within a mile, of 2,000 persons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>Take Whit Tor Camp. To man the wall it would
require 500 men. Allow to each man five noncombatants;
that gives a population of 2,500.
There are pounds and clusters of hut circles in
and about Whit Tor that still exist, and would have
contained that population. Take the Erme valley,
high up where difficult of access; the number of huts
there crowded on the hill slopes is incredible. On
the height is a cairn, surrounded by a ring of stones,
from which leads a line of upright blocks for a
distance of 10,840 feet. Allow two feet apart for
the stones, that gives 5,420 stones. If, as is probable,
each stone was set up by a male member of a tribe,
in honour of his chief who was interred in the cairn,
we are given by this calculation a population of over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
21,000, allowing three children and a female to each
male.</p>

</div>

<p>But numerous though these occupants of the moor
must have been, they must have been wretchedly
poor. The vast majority of their graves yield
nothing but a handful of burnt ash, not a potsherd,
not a flint-chip, and the grave of a chief
only a little blade of bronze as small as a modern
silver pocket fruit-knife.</p>

<p>That they were a peaceable people I have no
manner of doubt, for there are absolutely no fortified
hilltops on the moor, which there assuredly
would be were the denizens of that upland region
in strife one with another. What camps there are
may be found on the fringe, Whit Tor, Dewerstone,
Hembury, Holne, Cranbrook, Halstock, as against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
invaders. That they were a happy people I cannot
doubt. They were uncivilised: and the Tree
of Knowledge, under high culture, bears bitter
fruit for the many and drips with tears, but it
bears nuts&mdash;only for the few.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> "Hardly had we descended the narrow path, when we saw before
us several huge stones, like enormous boulders, placed endways perpendicularly,
on the soil, while some of them yet upheld similar masses,
laid transversely over their summit. They were arranged in a curve
once forming part, it would appear, of a large circle, and many other like
fragments lay rolled on the ground at a moderate distance; the number
of those still upright was, to speak by memory, eight or nine. Two,
at about ten or twelve feet apart one from the other, and resembling
huge gateposts, yet bore their horizontal lintel, a long block laid
across them; a few were deprived of their upper traverse, the rest
supported each its headpiece in defiance of time and the more destructive
efforts of man. So nicely balanced did one of these cross-bars
appear, that in hope it might prove a rocking-stone, I guided my
camel right under it, and then, stretching up my riding-stick at arm's
length, could just manage to touch and push it; but it did not stir.
Meanwhile the respective heights of camel, rider, and stick, taken
together, would place the stone in question full fifteen feet from the
ground. These blocks seem, by their quality, to have been hewed
from the neighbouring limestone cliffs and roughly shaped, but present
no further trace of art, no groove or cavity of sacrificial import, much
less anything intended for figure or ornament. The people of the
country attribute their erection to the Dārim, and by his own hands
too, seeing that he was a giant. Pointing towards Rass, our companions
affirmed that a second and similar stone circle, also of gigantic
dimensions, existed there; and, lastly, they mentioned a third towards
the south-west, that is, in the direction of Henakeeyah."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Palgrave</span>,

comparatively modern.</p></div>


<p class="drop-capw"><span class="smcap">As</span> already intimated, the antiquities found on
Dartmoor belong almost exclusively to the
Prehistoric Period. The few exceptions are the
crosses and the blowing-houses. These shall be
spoken of in other chapters. In this we will confine
ourselves to a general review of the relics left
to show how that the moor was occupied by a large
population in the early Bronze Period.</p>

<p>Now, although these relics are very numerous,
they are none of them megalithic, that is to say,
very huge. And this for two reasons. In the
first place it is uncertain whether the people occupying
the moor ever did erect any huge stones,
like the Stonehenge monsters, or the enormous
dolmens of Brittany, and above all of the sandstone
districts of the Loire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>In the second place, in the fifteenth and first
half of the sixteenth centuries the great bulk of
the churches round Dartmoor were rebuilt, and in
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the manor
houses, bartons, and farms were also reconstructed,
and then for the first time since the sixth century
was granite employed in ecclesiastical and domestic
architecture. The builders delighted in selecting
huge stones. They employed monoliths for their
pillars; each door and window had a single stone
on each side as a jamb, and a single stone as a
base; two stones above were used for the arch of
every door and window. The amount of granite
of a large size carried away from the moor is
really prodigious, and no large monument was
likely to have been spared.</p>

<p>Then came the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries,
when granite was in demand for gateposts,
and every standing stone serviceable was ruthlessly
carried away. Almost every circle of upright stones
has lost some of its finest blocks in this way, and all
that is left to show where they were is the hole cut
in the "calm" from which they were extracted, and
the <em>spalls</em> or chips made by the quarrymen as they
knocked the block into shape. At Sherberton was
a fine circle: the three largest stones have been employed
a few yards off as gateposts, and two others
have been cast down.</p>

<p>Next came the newtake-wall builders. The
ravage they have wrought is incalculable. In 1848
S. Rowe published his <cite>Perambulation of Dartmoor</cite>,
and gave an illustration of double stone rows that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
ran from the Longstone, near Caistor Rock, for half
a mile to the Teign. In 1851 I planned them. A few
years ago a farmer built a newtake wall, and used
the rows as his quarry; nothing now is left of them
but a few insignificant stones he did not consider
worth his while to remove. The stones are in the
wall, and can be recognised, and the socket-holes can
all be traced, with a spade.</p>

<p>There was a row or set of rows of stones on a
common near Leusden. In 1898 the road-menders
destroyed it and employed the stones for the repair
of the Ashburton highway.</p>

<p>Now it is quite possible that the old rude stone
monument builders did not erect really mighty structures
on Dartmoor, but it is still more likely that all
such as were of any size have been carried away.
Lake-head Hill, near Post Bridge, must at one time
have been a veritable necropolis. The farmer at
Bellever was given his holding on a rent that was
to be mainly paid by inclosing new-takes, and repairing
old walls. For six years he was employed
in clearing Lake-head Hill of all the stones he could
find. Thousands of loads were removed, and it is
only by a lucky chance that one or two kistvaens
have escaped. Three pounds with their huts, probably
scores of kistvaens, and certainly several stone
rows, have been obliterated by this man. In 1851
I drew the finest moor kistvaen at Merrivale Bridge.
The covering stone measured 9 feet 3 inches by
4 feet 9 inches. In 1891 a man at Merrivale Bridge
wanting a gatepost, cut one out of the capstone and
left only two scraps <i lang="la">in situ</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>Considering the ruthless manner in which these
monuments of a hoar antiquity have been carried
away or destroyed, it is a marvel that any remain;
but then, this devastation explains why those allowed
to remain are such only as were considered too insignificant
to offer inducement to the plunderer.
The late Mr. Bennett, of Archerton, when inclosing
and planting, utilised a fine pound for a clump of
beech. The old inclosing ring was used up to make
a wall for the protection of the young trees, and
these latter, in growing, threw all the huts that had
not been despoiled out of shape and into inextricable
confusion.</p>

<p>Let us now take in their order such monuments
as remain, and I will say a few words about each
kind.</p>

<p>1. Of the characteristic <em>dolmen</em>, which we in
England perhaps improperly call <em>cromlech</em>, we have
but a single good example, that at Drewsteignton.
The dolmen was the family mausoleum. It is composed
of several large slabs set upright in box-form,
and covered with one or more large stones, flat on
the under side. These were probably all originally
covered with earth, but in course of time the earth
has been washed or trodden away. In some cases
the dolmen becomes the <i lang="fr">allée couverte</i>, a long chamber
or hall constructed of uprights and coverers.
The most magnificent example is that at Saumur,
on the Loire, which is over 62 feet long and 13 feet
wide, and high enough for a tall man to walk about
in it with ease.</p>

<p>In these the dead were interred, not burnt, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
their bones seem to have been taken out on
anniversaries, scraped, and then replaced; and remoter
ancestors were huddled into the background
to make room for newcomers.</p>

<p>In time the fashion for carnal interment gave way
to one for cremation.</p>

<p>Now of the large dolmen or cromlech we have
only the fine Drewsteignton example, and that
deserves a visit. Formerly it was but one of a
number of monuments, lines and circles of upright
stones. All these have been destroyed in this
century.</p>

<p>But although this is the sole remaining example,
we know by place names that anciently there were
many more. These monuments have everywhere a
local designation. In France they are <i lang="fr">pierres levées</i>
or <i lang="fr">cabannes des fées</i>. In Devon they were shelf-stones,
and wherever we meet with a farm called
Shilston, there we may confidently assert that a
dolmen formerly existed. With a little search the
portions of it may occasionally be recognised in
pigsties, or worked into the structure of the house.</p>

<p>The parish of Bradstone derives its name from
the broad coverer of a cromlech, which is now employed
as a stile. The supporters have disappeared,
used probably for the church. There is a shilstone
in Bridestowe, and another in Modbury. In dolmens
it is usual to have a hole in the end stone, and even
sometimes closed with a stone plug, or else a small
stone is employed that could easily be removed, so
as to enable those who desired it to enter and put
therein food for the consumption of the dead, or to
remove the remains for the annual scraping, or again
for the introduction of a fresh tenant.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

<div class="caption"><p>THE PEDIGREE OF A TOMB</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>2. When carnal interment gave way to incineration,
at once the need for large mausoleums ceased,
and mourners saved themselves the labour of erecting
huge cromlechs, and contented themselves instead
with the more modest <em>kistvaen</em>, or stone chest. This
is constructed in precisely the same manner as the
dolmen, but is much smaller. A beautiful diminutive
example, from Peter Tavy Common, has been
transported to the Plymouth Municipal Museum. It
measures 21 inches long, 13 inches wide, and 14
inches deep. On Dartmoor there are many hundreds
of these kistvaens, of various sizes, but most have
been rifled by treasure-seekers; indeed, all but such
as were covered with earth and so escaped observation
have been plundered.</p>

<p>The kistvaens were always buried under cairns,
and almost invariably a circle of stones surrounded
the cairn, marking its bounds.</p>

<p>The finest kistvaens are&mdash;one at Merrivale Bridge,
one adjoining a pound near Post Bridge, one on
Lake-head Hill, one near Drizzlecombe, one on
Hound Tor, and two on the slope of Bellever. One
is near the Powder Mills. There are several, also,
about the Plym.</p>

<p>3. The <em>stone circle</em> is called by the French a
cromlech. The name means curved stone. The
circle, of which Stonehenge is the noblest known
example in Europe, consists of a number of stones
set up at intervals in a ring. The purport is purely
conjectural. Undoubtedly interments have been made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
within them; but none, so far, have been found in
those on Dartmoor. In the great circle on Penmaen-mawr
there were burials at the foot of several of the
monoliths, and, indeed, one of these served as the
back-stone of a kistvaen.</p>

<p>Among semi-barbarous tribes it is customary that
the tribe should have its place of assembly and consultation,
and this is marked round by either stones
or posts set up in the ground. Among some of the
great clan circles, if one of the constituent tribes fails
to send its representative, the stone set up where he
would sit is thrown down.</p>

<p>The areas within the circles on Dartmoor, so far
as they have been examined, show that great fires
have been lighted in them; the floors are thickly
bedded in charcoal. It may be that they were the
crematoria of the tribe, and certainly numerous
cairns and kistvaens are to be found around them;
or it may be that great fires were lighted in them
when the tribe met for its parliament, or its games
and war-dances. It has been noticed that usually
these circles of upright stones are placed on the neck
of land between two rivers.</p>

<p>Some have speculated that they were intended for
astronomical observation, and for determining the
solstices; but such fancies may be dismissed till we
have evidence of their being erected and employed
for such a purpose by some existing savage race.</p>

<p>The Samoyeds were wont to make circles of stones
of rude blocks set up, and these are still to be seen
in the districts they inhabit; and although these
people are nominally Christians, yet they are secretly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
addicted to their old paganism. Mr. Jackson, in his
<cite>Great Frozen Land</cite> (London, 1895), says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The rings of stones which I frequently met with in
Waigatz are the sites of their midnight services, and are
made, of course, by the Samoyeds. They are called
yon-pa-ha-pai. It is possible that within these circles
the human sacrifices with which Samoyeds used to propitiate
Chaddi were offered up; and, although these are
things of the past now, it is only a few years ago that
a Samoyed, living in Novaia Zemlia, sacrificed a young
girl" (p. 89).</p></div>

<p>A tradition or fancy relative to more than one
of these circles is that the stones represent maidens
who insisted on dancing on a Sunday, and were, for
their profanity, turned into stone when the church
bells rang for divine service. It is further said that
on May Day or Midsummer Day they dance in a
ring.</p>

<p>There are several of these circles on the moor.
The finest are those of Scaur Hill, near Chagford,
of the Grey Wethers&mdash;two side by side, but most
of the stones of one are fallen&mdash;the circle on
Langstone Moor above Peter Tavy, Trowlesworthy,
Sherberton, and Fernworthy. The diameters vary
from thirty-six feet to three hundred and sixty.
One that must have been very fine was near
Huccaby, but most of the stones constituting it
have been removed for the construction of a wall
hard by.</p>

<p>The number of stones employed varies according
to the area inclosed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>4. The <em>stone row</em> is almost invariably associated
with cairns and kistvaens, and clearly had some
relation to funeral rites. The stone settings are
often single, sometimes double, or are as many as
eight. They do not always run parallel; they start
from a cairn, and end with a blocking-stone set across
the line. In Scotland they are confined to Caithness.
The finest known are at Carnac, in Brittany. It is
probable that just as a Bedouin now erects a stone
near a fakir's tomb as a token of respect, so each
of these rude blocks was set up by a member of a
tribe, or by a household, in honour of the chief buried
in the cairn at the head of the row.</p>

<p>It is remarkable how greatly the set stones vary in
size. Some are quite insignificant, and could be
planted by a boy, while others require the united
efforts of three, four, or even many men, with modern
appliances of three legs and block, to lift and place
them in position. This seems to show that the rows
are not the result of concerted design, but of individual
execution as the ability of the man or
family permitted to set up a stone large or small.
Usually the largest stones are planted near the cairn,
and they dwindle to the blocking-stone, which is of
respectable size.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

<div class="caption"><p>STONE-ROWS, DRIZZLECOMBE</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>There is no district known so rich in stone rows as
Dartmoor. As many as fifty have been observed. The
finest are those of Drizzlecombe, where there are
three double rows, not parallel; Down Tor, a single
line; Merrivale Bridge, two parallel double rows, but
the stones constituting them small; Stall Moor, a
single line that looks like a procession of cricketers
in flannels stalking over the moor; Challacombe; at
Glazebrook are thirteen rows; also Staldon Moor.
Some of these rows which are small are nevertheless
instructive. On the north slope of Cosdon is a cairn
that originally contained three kistvaens, one of which
is perfect, one exists in part, and evidence of the
existence of the third was found on exploration.
From this cairn start three rows of stones, one for
each kistvaen. A remarkably perfect set of stone
rows is on Watern Hill, behind the Warren Inn, on
the road from Post Bridge to Moreton. It is actually
visible from the road, but as the stones are small
it does not attract attention. It starts from a cairn
and a tall upright stone set at right angles to the
rows, which are brought to a termination by blocking-stones.
Another perfect row is at Assacombe, starting
from a cairn with two or three big upright stones,
and running down a rather steep hill to a blocking-stone
which remains intact.</p>

<p>The longest of all the rows is that on Staldon,
which springs from a circle of 59 feet 9 inches in
diameter, inclosing the remains of a cairn, runs with
a single line for two miles and a quarter, and crosses
the Erme river. Had a straight line been followed,
an obstruction in the precipitous bank of the river
would have been encountered, to avoid which the
builders of this great monument took a sweep eastward,
where the bank was more sloping. In the
Cosdon lines of stones already referred to, the rows
waver so as to avoid a platform of rock in which the
constructors were unable to plant their stones.</p>

<p>At Drizzlecombe there is a cairn with which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
connected a row 260 feet long, with an upright stone
17 feet 9 inches high at the end of the row.</p>

<p>All sorts of random guesses have been made
about these rows. Some have made them out to be
sacred <em>cursi</em>, where races were run, but then some
lines are single, some are eightfold. Others have
supposed that these were the supporting stones to
cattle sheds, but these stones are often not more than
2 feet 6 inches high, and the rows often run for over
600 feet.</p>

<p>We must, as already said, look to present usage
for their interpretation, and that afforded by the
practice of the Khassias of the Brahmapootra, and
by the Bedouin, seems the simplest&mdash;stones set up
as memorials or tributes of respect to the dead man
who is buried at the head of the row.</p>

<p>There would seem to have been no feeling attached
to the direction in which these lines run.</p>

<p>One singular feature is that in several cases a
second row starts off from a small cairn in or close
to the main row, and runs away in quite a different
direction.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>5. The <em>menhir</em>, or tall stone, is a rude, unwrought
obelisk. In some cases it is nothing other
than the starting or the blocking stone of a row
which has been destroyed. This is the case with
that at Merrivale Bridge. But such is not always
the case. There were no rows in connection with
the menhirs on Devil Tor and the Whitmoor
Stone.</p>

<p>That the upright block is a memorial to the dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
can hardly be doubted; it was continued to be
erected, with an inscription on it, in Romano-British
times, and its modern representative is in every
churchyard.</p>

<p>The menhirs, locally termed longstones, or langstones,
must at one time have been numerous.
There was a langstone near Sourton, another by
Tavistock, one at Sheeps Tor, others by Modbury;
these stones have disappeared and have left but
their names to tell where they once stood. One
on Peter Tavy Common gave its title to the moor
which the Ordnance surveyors have rendered Launceston
Moor. The stone is at one end of a row, and
served as a waymark over the down. It had fallen,
but is re-erected.</p>

<p>But there are still a good many remaining. The
tallest is one already referred to at Drizzlecombe.
Bairdown Man (<em>maen</em> = a stone) is by Devil Tor in
a singularly desolate spot. We have none comparable
to the Devil's Arrows at Boroughbridge in
Yorkshire&mdash;but the best have been carried away
to serve as monolithic church pillars.</p>

<p>The Chinese hold that the spirits of the dead
inhabit the memorials set up in their honour; and
the carved monoliths in Abyssinia, erected by the
race when it passed from Arabia to Africa, have
carved in their faces little doors, for the ingress and
egress of the spirits. Holed menhirs are found in
many places. I know one in France, La Pierre
Fiche, near Pouancé (Maine-et-Loire), where such a
little door or window, intended for the popping out
and in of the spirit, has been utilised to hold an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
image of the Virgin, and has been barred to prevent
the statue making off or being made off with.</p>

<p>In Irish post-Christian records there is frequent
allusion to the early saints carrying about their <em>lechs</em>
(flat stones) with them, to be set up over them when
dead, and this explains the fantastic stories afterwards
told of saints as of having crossed from
Ireland to Wales, or Cornwall, or Brittany floating
on stones. In the original record it was related that
the saint came over with his <em>lech</em>, and a later redactor
of the story converted this into coming <em>on</em> it, as a
raft. The <em>lech</em> was cut into a cross when the Celts
became Christians, or crosses were inscribed on them.
Some of the most fantastic of the saints, when
travelling over the country, would not sit down to
dinner till they had visited and prayed at all the
crosses set up over tombs anywhere near.</p>

<p>A pretty story is told of S. Cainnech. Bishop
Aed's sister had been carried off by Colman
MacDermot, King of the Hy Niall, and he refused
to surrender her. Aed went to Cainnech with his
grievance, and Cainnech at once resolved on intervention.
Colman had retired to an island in the
Ross Lake, or Marsh, and shrewdly suspecting that
the saint would administer a lecture, he removed the
boats to the island fort or crannoge. However, Cainnech
was not to be deterred, and managed to wade
or swim across. Subdued by his pertinacity, the
king surrendered the girl.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>MENHIR, CROSS AND HEADSTONE</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>Many years after, one winter day, Cainnech was
traversing a moor, when he noticed a rude stone
cross, on the head and arms of which the snow lay
in a crust. He halted to inquire whose cross that
was, and learned that it had been erected on the spot
where King Colman had been assassinated some
years previously. Cainnech at once went to the <em>lech</em>,
leaned his brow against it, and as he recalled the
interviews he had had with the king, and thought
on his good as well as his bad qualities, his outbursts
of violence, and his accesses of compunction, the old
man's tears began to flow, and his disciples noticed
the snow melting and dripping from the arms of the
cross, thawed by the tears of the venerable abbot.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 482px;">
<img src="images/p065.jpg" width="482" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Cross, Whitchurch Down.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Now see how many rugged crosses there are on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
Dartmoor! Some certainly are waymarks, others
as surely indicate graves. Would that we knew the
tales connected with them!</p>

<p>Then go into any churchyard and observe the
tombstones. We are children of the men who set
up menhirs, and we do the same thing to this day,
though the stones we erect are mean and small compared
with the great standing monoliths they set up
to their dead.</p>

<p>In many of the churches around the moor are
monuments that derive from the cromlech and kistvaens
as certainly as does the modern tombstone
from the menhir. The graveyard of Sourton was
rich in these great slabs standing on four supporters.
A late rector who "restored" Sourton church, and
supposed he did God service by so doing, threw all
these down and employed the slabs as pavement to
the church paths; he placed the supporters outside
in the village for anyone to carry off as he listed.</p>

<p>The finest menhirs on Dartmoor are&mdash;one at
Drizzlecombe, the Langstone near Caistor Rock,
the Whitmoor Stone, the Bairdown Man, the Langstone
at Merrivale, and that on Langstone Moor,
Peter Tavy. There must have been numbers more,
for their former presence is testified to by many
place names. They have been carried off, and it
is matter of wonder that any remain.</p>

<p>6. <em>Hut circles.</em> The cairn and kistvaen were
the places of burial of the dead, but the hut circles
were the habitations of the living. So many of them
have been dug out during the last six years, that we
may safely draw conclusions as to the period to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
which they belong. They were occupied by the
Neolithic population that at one time thickly covered
Dartmoor.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 643px;">
<img src="images/p067.jpg" width="643" height="700" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In the <cite>Archæologia</cite> of 1875 is an account of the
exploration of a set of hut circles near Bintley,
Northumberland, and this revealed successive occupation
by Celts (?) of the Bronze Age; then Romano-British,
who left fragments of Samian ware and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
bronze horse-buckle; lastly by Saxons, who left
behind an iron sword.</p>

<p>Not a trace of continuous occupation has been
found in any circle explored on Dartmoor. All
belong to the early Bronze Period, when flint was
the principal material of which tools and weapons
were fabricated.</p>

<p>Some account of these huts has been already
given. They usually have a raised platform on the
side that is towards the hill, and the circle bulges
at this point to give additional space on this platform.
It was probably used as a bed by night, and
was sat upon by day. In one hut at Grimspound
the platform was divided into two compartments.
In some instances, small upright stones planted in
the floor show that the platform was made of logs
and brushwood, held in place by these projections.
The stone platforms on the other hand were paved.</p>

<p>The doorways into the huts are composed of single
upright stones as jambs, with a threshold and a
lintel, this latter always fallen, and often found
wedged between the uprights. The floor within is
paved near the door, but there only; the rest consists
of hard beaten soil. Occasionally a shelter wall
protects the entrance from the prevailing wind. The
huts must have been entered on all-fours; the doorways
are never higher than three feet six inches,
usually less. The huts have hearthstones much
burnt or broken, but occasionally hollows lined with
stones full of ashes. Cooking-holes are sunk in the
floor near the hearths, and piles of cooking stones
are found at hand much cracked by fire. Sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
a flat stone is found bedded in the soil near the centre
to support a pole that sustained the roof. In some
instances a hole has been discovered sunk in the
floor near the middle, with the charred remains of
the bottom end of the post in it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 382px;">
<img src="images/p069.jpg" width="382" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>HUT CIRCLE, GRIMSPOUND.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>In the cooking-holes have been found cooking-pots
made by hand of the coarsest clay, usually round at
the bottom; where not round, with transverse ridges
of thick clay forming a cross to strengthen the
bottom. These pots were too fragile to stand the
action of fire on a hearth, and served by having
meat and red-hot stones placed in them. Consequently
they do not show signs of exposure to
strong fire externally, and are black with animal
matter within, which may be extracted by means
of a blowpipe.</p>

<p>One found at Legis Tor had been cracked and
was mended with china-clay. It had a cooking-stone
in it. There would seem to have been in use as well
shallower vessels that were covered with round slate
discs. None of these have been recovered whole.
Possibly they were employed to hold curd or butter.</p>

<p>Occasionally round stones, flat on one side and
convex on the other, have been disinterred in the
huts. They served to protect the apex of the roof,
where the poles were drawn together, from the action
of the rain, which would rot them, as well as to
prevent the rain from entering at this point. An
example of a stone of the same character employed
for this very purpose may be seen in actual use
on a thatched circular pounding-house on Berry
Down, near Throwleigh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>Not a single quern has been found in a hut, and
this indicates that the occupants neither grew nor
ground corn extensively.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> They lived mainly on
milk and meat. Numerous rubber-stones have been
unearthed that served for smoothing the seams of
skin clothing sewn together; and plenty of flint
scrapers that turn up show that the skins employed
for garments were previously carefully scraped and
cleaned. Esquimaux women chew the leather to get
it flexible, and then rub it with similar smoothers
of stone.</p>

<p>7. <em>Tracklines</em> in abundance are everywhere found,
made of stones, but without close investigation it is
not possible to determine to what period they belong.</p>

<p>8. Paved roads exist; the main road across the
moor has been traced from Wray Barton in Moreton
Hampstead, by Berry Pound to Merripit, by Post
Bridge, and thence on to Mis Tor. From somewhere
near the Powder Mills a branch struck off in
the direction of Princetown, aiming probably for
Tamerton, but it has been obliterated by the prison
inclosures. A raised paved road leaves the camp
above Okehampton Station and takes a direction due
south, but cannot be traced far. That these ways
were not Roman is tolerably certain. The ancient
Britons drove chariots with wheels, and where
wheeled conveyances were in use, there roads are
postulated.</p>

<p>9. The <em>cairns</em> that are abundant, and were of
considerable size, have nearly all been ransacked by
treasure-seekers. Only such as were too small to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
attract attention have escaped. They are mounds of
earth and stone over a pit sunk in the original soil, or
over a kistvaen. Usually they contain a handful of
ashes only; they rarely yield more. One, however, on
Hamildon surrendered a bronze knife with amber
handle and rivets of gold. Others have given up
small knives of bronze, and urns of the characteristic
shape and ornamentation of the Bronze Age.
In one, on Fernworthy Common, was found a thin
blade of copper, along with a flint knife, a large
button of horn, and a well-ornamented urn.</p>

<p>A cairn surrounded by a circle of stones, and
containing a kistvaen, near Princetown, is called
"The Crock of Gold," a name that may be due
to a vessel of the precious metal having been found
in it.</p>

<p>One thing is obvious, the enormous labour of
exploring the larger cairns would not have been
undertaken unless previous ransackings had yielded
valuable results. Some of the cairns must have
been huge, and have taken many men several days
in clearing out their interiors. About these cairns
I shall say a good deal in a chapter apart.</p>

<p>10. Of <em>camps</em> there are two kinds, those constructed
of stone and those of earth. I reserve what I have
to say about these to a separate chapter.</p>

<p>11. The old stone <em>bridges</em>, composed of rude slabs
cast across an opening to a pier, also rudely constructed,
have been attributed to "the Druids," of
course. There is nothing to indicate for these a
great antiquity. They belong to the period of pack-horses,
and were doubtless often repaired. Those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
at Dartmeet, and Post Bridge, and Two Bridges&mdash;this
last has disappeared&mdash;were in the line of
the pack-horse track, and <em>not</em> in that of the paved
way across the moor.</p>

<p>The rude bridge at Okery in like manner is in the
pack-horse line of way, which is indicated between
Princetown and Merrivale Bridge by rude posts of
granite set up at intervals.</p>

THE FREAKS</h2>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Lucubrations of antiquaries in past times&mdash;How their imagination led
them astray&mdash;Rock idols&mdash;Logan stones&mdash;Who originated the idea
that they were oracular&mdash;Rock basins&mdash;Tolmens&mdash;The difference
between the modern system of archæological research and that which
it has supplanted.</p></div>


<p class="drop-capw"><span class="smcap">It</span> would be amusing were it not melancholy to
read the lucubrations of antiquaries of the early
part of the nineteenth century on the relics of the
past found in such abundance on the moor. Their
imagination played a large part in their researches,
and references to curious customs in the Bible or
in classic writings were drawn in to explain these
relics. The antiquaries lacked the faculty of observing
accurately, and instead of labouring to accumulate
facts, and recording them with precision,
employed them as pegs on which to hang their
theories, and they whittled at what they did observe,
so as to fit what they saw to elucidate these theories.</p>

<p>In rambling over the moor they discovered rock
idols, logan stones, rock basins, and tolmens, and
entered into long dissertations on their employment
for worship, oracles, lustrations, and ordeals.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 670px;">
<img src="images/p074.jpg" width="670" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>BOWERMAN'S NOSE</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>There are, indeed, to be seen curious piles of rock,
but none of these are artificial, and there is not a
particle of evidence that any of them received
idolatrous worship. Bowerman's Nose is the most
remarkable, perhaps. Carrington, the poet of Dartmoor,
thus describes it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">"On the very edge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the vast moorland, startling every eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A shape enormous rises! High it towers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above the hill's bold brow, and seen from far,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Assumes the human form; a granite god,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To whom, in days long flown, the suppliant knee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In trembling homage bow'd."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>It stands up, a core of hard granite, forty feet high,
in five layers above a "clitter," the softer masses
that have fallen off from it. Had it ever been
venerated as an idol, the worshippers would assuredly
have done something towards clearing this clitter
away, so as to give themselves a means of easy
access to their idol, and some turf on which to
kneel in adoration.</p>

<p>Another remarkable pile is Vixen Tor, presenting
from one point a resemblance to the Sphinx.
Not a single relic of early man is in its immediate
neighbourhood. We can hardly doubt that prehistoric
man was not as big a fool as we suppose
him, and that he was quite able to see that Bowerman's
Nose and Vixen Tor were natural objects as
truly as the tors on the hilltops.</p>

<p>The logan stones on the moor are numerous,
and these, also, are natural formations. The granite
weathers irregularly; a hard bed alternates with one
that is soft, and the wind and rain eat into the
more crumbling layer and gnaw it away, till the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
harder superincumbent mass rests on one or two
points. Either it topples over and becomes one
more block in a clitter, or it remains balanced, and,
if fairly evenly balanced, can be made to rock like
a cradle.</p>

<p>Here is a specimen of tall twaddle from the hand
of Mrs. Bray or the Rev. E. Atkyns Bray, her
husband:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"There must have been a more than ordinary feeling of
awe inspired in the mind of the criminal by ascending
heights covered with a multitude, to whose gaze he was
exposed, as he drew nigh and looked upon these massive
rocks, the seat of divine authority and judgment. How
imposing must have been the sight of the priesthood and
their numerous trains, surrounded by all the outward pomps
and insignia of their office; as he listened to the solemn
hymns of the vates, preparatory to the ceremonial of justice;
or as he stepped within the sacred inclosure, there to
receive condemnation or acquittal, to be referred to the
ordeal of the logan, or the tolmen, according to the will
of the presiding priest! As he slowly advanced and
thought upon these things, often must he have shuddered
and trembled to meet the Druid's eye, when he stood by
'the stone of his power.'"</p></div>

<p>All this rubbish is based on supposition. There
is not a particle of evidence to support it. Toland
was the first to start the theory that logan stones
were used for ordeal purposes or as oracles. He
says: "The Druids made the people believe that
they alone could move these stones, and by a miracle
only, by which pretended power they condemned or
acquitted the accused, and often brought criminals to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
confess what could in no other way be extorted from
them." Here is a positive statement. Toland died
in 1722. Whence did Toland derive this? From
his imagination only. Then Rowe quotes him as his
authority for attributing to the logan stones this
function of delivering oracular judgments. Appeal
was wont to be made to a line in Ossian as a support
for the theory, but since Ossian has been proved to
be a fraud antiquaries are chary of referring to
him.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>LOGAN ROCK. THE RUGGLESTONE, WIDDECOMBE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>There are some really fine logan rocks on Dartmoor.
Perhaps the largest is one above the West
Okement, which I remember seeing many years ago,
when a boy, rolling in a strong wind like a boat at
sea. That on Rippon Tor measures 16½ feet in
length, and is about 4½ feet in thickness and nearly
the same in breadth. It still logs, but not so well as
formerly, owing to mischievous interference with it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
There is a large one in the Teign, above Fingle
Bridge, that can also be made to roll with the
application of a little strength.</p>

<p>The Rugglestone, near Widdecombe-in-the-Moor,
measures 22 feet by 14 feet in one part, and 19 feet
by 17 feet in another, and is 5 feet 6 inches in mean
thickness. Its computed weight is 110 tons, whereas
the celebrated logan in Cornwall weighs 90 tons.
This stone is poised upon two points.</p>

<p>Roos Tor, which the Ordnance surveyors playfully
render Rolls Tor, possessed two logan stones, but
quarrymen have destroyed one, together with the
fine mass of rock on which it stood. Near it
lay a huge menhir, never removed till these depredators
broke it up. I give an illustration of the
head of the tor with its two logans, taken in 1852;
one alone remains. On Black Tor, near the road
from Princetown to Plymouth, is a small logan, with
a rock basin on the top, and with a projection like
a handle. It can be made to oscillate without
difficulty. A small logan is near the stone rows on
Challacombe in the miners' workings. Its existence
is purely accidental. Another is near a collection
of hut circles on the slope of Combeshead Tor.</p>

<p>The rock basins are numerous; they are hollow
pans formed on the surface of granite slabs by the
action of wind and water, assisted by particles of
grit set in rotation by the wind. "That this rude
and primitive species of basin formed part of the
apparatus of Druidism there can be little doubt,"
says Mr. Rowe, "but the specific purpose for which
they were designed is not clear." Fosbroke un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>hesitatingly
pronounces rock basins to be "cavities
<em>cut</em> in the surface of a rock, supposed for reservoirs,
to preserve the rain or dew in its original purity, for
the religious uses of the Druids."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/p079.jpg" width="700" height="274" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>ROOS TOR, WITH ITS LOGANS, PREVIOUS TO DESTRUCTION.</p></div>
</div>

<p>All this assertion must be put aside. The bowls
are excavated by natural agencies, and there is not
a scrap of evidence to show that they were put to
superstitious or any other use. The largest is on
Caistor Rock, and this has been railed round, as
sheep floundered in and got drowned, or could not
get out again. Mis Tor has a fine basin, called "The
Devil's Frying-pan."</p>

<p>These basins may be seen in all stages of growth
on the tops of the tors.</p>

<p>The tolmen is either a holed stone or a rock
supported in such a manner as to preserve it from
falling, and supposed to have been used as an
apparatus of ordeal, by requiring those accused of a
crime to creep through the orifice.</p>

<p>Holed stones have unquestionably been employed
for the purpose of taking oaths and sealing com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>pacts,
the hands being passed through an opening
and clasped. And certainly S. Wilfrid's needle, in
the crypt under Ripon Minster, was made use of
as a test to try whether a maiden accused of incontinency
was guilty or not. There is, however,
no well-defined tolmen on Dartmoor that can be
pronounced to be artificial. A holed stone in the
Teign was pierced by the action of the water, and
a suspended rock at an incline on Staple Tor, called
by Mrs. Bray and Mr. Rowe a tolmen, is a natural
production also. It is, of course, possible that stones
thus poised may have been employed for the purpose,
but we have no evidence that those on Dartmoor
were so used.</p>

<p>Of rocks supported at one end by a small stone
there are plenty. There is a good one on Yar Tor,
above Dartmeet.</p>

<p>The old school of antiquaries started with a theory,
and then sought for illustrations to fit into their
theories, and took facts and distorted them to serve
their purpose, or saw proofs where no proofs existed.
The new school accumulates statistics and piles up
facts, and then only endeavours to work out a
plausible theory to account for the facts laboriously
collected and registered. It never starts with a
theory, but applies practices in savage life still in
use to explain the customs of prehistoric men, who
lived on the same cultural level as the savages of
the present day.</p>

<p>One word of caution must be given relative to the
Druids, who are credited with so much. It is true
that there were Druids in Britain and in Ireland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
but they were the schamans, or medicine-men, of the
earlier Ivernian race, who maintained their repute
among the conquering Celts, and their representatives
at the present day are the white witches who practise
on the credulity of our villagers.</p>

theory of wearing mourning&mdash;Its real origin&mdash;Various modes
of deceiving the dead or discouraging them from returning&mdash;The
desire of the ghost to get home&mdash;Is cajoled or scared away&mdash;How

the dead.</p></div>


<p class="drop-capw"><span class="smcap">One</span> of the most striking experiences of an
explorer of Dartmoor is the coming upon
great cairns in the most remote and inaccessible
parts of that waste. Not a lone hill surrounded by
bogs is without its great mound of earth or pile of
stones over some dead man. In the howling wilderness
about Cranmere Pool, where are no traces of
human habitation, there lie the dead. On every rise
above the swamps and fathomless morasses of Fox
Tor, there they are scattered thick. Almost always
the dead were conveyed to the tops of hills, or
placed on the brows of elevations far away from the
settlements of the living.</p>

<p>Why was this?</p>

<p>Because prehistoric men were in fear of their dead
people.</p>

<p>I remember, in 1860, riding across the central
desert of Iceland, and coming about midnight, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
the summer sun was just dipped below the polar
sea, on a solitary cairn among pools of frozen water
and amidst illimitable tracts of volcanic ash. My
guide told me it was the grave of one Glamr, who
had so haunted the farms in the Vatnsdal that the
people of the valley had combined to dig him up and
transport the corpse almost a day's journey into the
central desert, where they cut off his head, and buried
the body in a sitting posture with his own skull as his
throne, an indignity which the ghost was likely to so
resent as never to venture to show again.</p>

<p>The heathen Icelander, on the death of a father
in the family, was removed by the anxious heir to
the estate in an ingenious manner. The wall of the
house behind the bed was broken through, and the
corpse drawn out of doors by that way, and then the
opening was hastily repaired. He was then hurried
off to his grave. The heir was so afraid lest the
venerable party should saunter home again and reclaim
his property, that the father was carried forth
in this peculiar manner in order to bewilder him and
make him find a difficulty in returning.</p>

<p>A strip of black cloth an inch and a half in width
stitched round the sleeve&mdash;that is the final, or perhaps
penultimate relic (for it may dwindle further to
a black thread) of the usage of wearing mourning on
the decease of a relative.</p>

<p>The usage is one that commends itself to us as an
outward and visible sign of the inward sentiment of
bereavement, and not one in ten thousand who adopt
mourning has any idea that it ever possessed a
signification of another sort. And yet the correla<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>tion
of general custom&mdash;of mourning fashions&mdash;leads
us to the inexorable conclusion that in its inception
the practice had quite a different signification
from that now attributed to it, nay more, that it is
solely because its primitive meaning has been absolutely
forgotten, and an entirely novel significance
given to it, that mourning is still employed after a
death.</p>

<p>Look back through the telescope of anthropology
at our ancestors in their naked savagery after a death,
and we see them daub themselves with soot mingled
with tallow. When the savage assumed clothes and
became a civilised man, he replaced the fat and lampblack
with black cloth, and this black cloth has
descended to us in the nineteenth century as the
customary and intelligible trappings of woe.</p>

<p>The Chinaman when in a condition of bereavement
assumes white garments, and we may be pretty
certain that his barbarous ancestor, like the Andaman
Islander of the present day, pipe-clayed his
naked body after the decease and funeral of a
relative. In Egypt yellow was the symbol of sorrow
for a death, and that points back to the ancestral nude
Egyptian having smeared himself with yellow ochre.</p>

<p>Black was not the universal hue of mourning in
Europe. In Castile white obtained on the death of
its princes. Herrera states that the last time white
was thus employed was in 1498 on the death of
Prince John. This use of white indicates chalk or
pipe-clay as the daub affected by the ancestors of
the house of Castile in primeval time as a badge
of bereavement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>Various explanations have been offered to account
for the variance of colour. White has been supposed
to denote purity&mdash;and to this day white gloves and
hatbands and scarves are employed at the funeral
of a young girl.</p>

<p>Yellow has been supposed to symbolise that death
is the end of human hopes, because falling leaves are
sere; black is taken as the privation of light; and
purple or violet also affected as a blending of joy
with sorrow. Christian moralists have declaimed
against black as heathen, as denoting an aspect of
death devoid of hope, and gradually purple is taking
its place in the trappings of the hearse, if not of the
mourners, and the pall is now very generally violet.</p>

<p>But these explanations are after-thoughts, and an
attempt to give reason for the divergence of usage
which might satisfy: they are really no explanations
at all. The usage goes back to a period when there
were no such refinements of thought. If violet or
purple has been traditional, it is so merely because
the ancestral Briton stained himself with woad on the
death of a relative.</p>

<p>The pipe-clay, lampblack, yellow ochre, and woad
of the primeval mourners must be brought into
range with a whole series of other mourning usages,
and then the result is something of an "eye-opener."
It reveals a condition of mind and an aspect of death
that cause not a little surprise and amusement. It
is one of the most astonishing, and, perhaps, shocking
traits of barbarous life, that death revolutionises
completely the feelings of the survivors towards their
deceased husbands, wives, parents, and other relatives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>A married couple may have been sincerely attached
to each other so long as the vital spark was twinkling,
but the moment it is extinguished the dead partner
becomes, not a sadly sweet reminiscence, but an
object of the liveliest terror to the survivor. He
or she does everything that ingenuity can suggest to
get himself or herself out of all association in body
and spirit with the late lamented. Death is held to
be thoroughly demoralising to the deceased. However
exemplary a person he or she may have been in
life, after death the ghost is little less than a plaguing,
spiteful spirit.</p>

<p>There is in the savage no tender clinging to the
remembrance of the loved one; he is transformed into
a terrible bugbear, who must be evaded and avoided by
every contrivance conceivable. This is due, doubtless,
mainly to the inability of the uncultivated mind to
discriminate between what is seen waking from what
presents itself in phantasy to the dreaming head.
After a funeral it is natural enough for the mourners
to dream of the dead, and they at once conclude
that they have been visited by his <em>revenant</em>. After
a funeral feast&mdash;a great gorging of pork or beef&mdash;it
is very natural that the sense of oppression and pain
felt should be associated with the dear departed, and
should translate itself into the idea that he has come
from his grave to sit on the chests of those who have
bewailed him.</p>

<p>Moreover, the savage associates the idea of desolation,
death, discomfort, with the condition of the soul
after death, and believes that the ghosts do all they
can to return to their former haunts and associates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
for the sake of the warmth and food, the shelter of
the huts, and the entertainment of the society
of their fellows. But the living men and women
are not at all eager to receive the ghosts into the
family circle, and they accordingly adopt all kinds
of "dodges," expedients to prevent the departed from
making these irksome and undesired visits.</p>

<p>The Venerable Bede tells us that Laurence, Archbishop
of Canterbury, resolved on flying from
England because he was hopeless of effecting any
good under the successor of Ethelbert, King of
Kent. The night before he fled he slept on the
floor of the church, and dreamed that S. Peter
cudgelled him soundly for resolving to abandon his
sacred charge. In the morning he awoke stiff and
full of aches and pains. Turned into modern
language we should say that Archbishop Laurence
was attacked with rheumatism on account of his
having slept on the cold stones of the church. His
mind had been troubled before he went to sleep with
doubts whether he was doing right in abandoning
his duty, and very naturally this trouble of conscience
coloured his dream and gave to his rheumatic twinges
the complexion they assumed in his mind.</p>

<p>Now Archbishop Laurence regarded the Prince of
the Apostles in precisely the light in which a savage
views his deceased relatives and ancestors. He
associates his maladies, his pains, with them, if he
should happen to dream of them. If, however, when
in pain, he dreams of a living person, then he holds
that this living person has cast a magical spell over
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>Among Nature's men, before they have gone
through the mill of civilisation, plenty to eat and to
drink, and someone to talk to, are the essentials
of happiness. They see that the dead have none
of these requisites, they consider that they are
miserable without them. The writer remembers
how, when he was a boy, and attended the funeral
of a relative in November, he could not sleep all
night&mdash;a bitter frosty night&mdash;with the thought how
cold it must be to the dead in the vault, without
blankets, hot bottle, or fire. It was in vain for him
to reason against the feeling; the feeling was so
strong in him that he was conscious of an uncomfortable
expectation of the dead coming to claim
a share of the blanket, fire, or hot bottle. Now the
savage never reasons against such a feeling, and he
assumes that the dead will return, as a matter of
course, for what he cannot have in the grave.</p>

<p>The ghost is very anxious to assert its former
rights. A widow has to get rid of the ghost of
her first husband before she can marry again. In
Parma a widow about to be remarried is pelted with
sticks and stones, not in the least because the
Parmese object to remarriage, but in order to scare
away the ghost of number one who is hanging about
his wife, and who will resent his displacement in her
affections by number two.</p>

<p>To the present day, in some of the villages of the
ancient Duchy of Teck, in Würtemberg, it is customary
when a corpse is being conveyed to the cemetery
for the relatives and friends to surround the dead, and
in turn talk to it&mdash;assure it what a blessed rest it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
is going to; how anxious the kinsfolk are that it
may be comfortable; how handsome will be the cross
set over the grave; how much all desire that it may
sleep soundly and not by any means leave the grave
and come haunting old scenes and friends; how unreasonable
such conduct as the latter hinted at would
be&mdash;how it would alter the regard entertained for the
deceased, how disrespectful to the Almighty who
gives rest to the good, and how it would be regarded
as an admission of an uneasy conscience. Lively
comparisons are drawn between the joys of paradise
and the vale of tears that has been quitted, so as to
take away from the deceased all desire to return.</p>

<p>This is a survival of primitive usage and mode
of thought, and has its analogies in many places and
among diverse races.</p>

<p>The Dacotah Indians address the ghost of the
dead in the same "soft solder" to induce it to take
the road to the world of spirits, and not to come
sauntering back to its wigwam. In Siam and in
China it is much the same; persuasion, flattery,
threats, are employed.</p>

<p>Unhappily, all ghosts are not open to persuasion,
and see through the designs of the mourners, and
with them severer measures have to be resorted to.
Among the Slavs of the Danube and the Czechs,
the bereaved, after the funeral, on going home, turn
themselves about after every few steps, and throw
sticks, stones, mud, even hot coals, in the direction
of the churchyard, so as to frighten the spirit back
to the grave so considerately provided for it. A
Finnish tribe has not even the decency to wait till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
the corpse is covered with soil; they fire pistols and
guns after it as it goes to its grave.</p>

<p>In <em>Hamlet</em>, at the funeral of Ophelia, the priest
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i22">"For charitable prayers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Unquestionably it must have been customary in
England thus to pelt a ghost that was suspected
of the intention to wander. The stake driven
through the suicide's body was a summary way of
ensuring that his ghost should not be troublesome.</p>

<p>Those Finns who fired guns after a dead man had
another expedient for holding him fast, if the first
failed, and that was to nail him down in his coffin.
The Arabs tie his legs together. The Wallachs drive
a long nail through his skull; and this usage explains
the many skulls that have been exhumed in
Germany thus perforated.</p>

<p>The Californian Indians were wont to break the
spine of the corpse so as to paralyse his lower limbs
and make "walking" impossible. Spirit and body,
to the unreasoning mind, are intimately associated.
A hurt done to the body wounds the soul. Mrs.
Crowe, in her <cite>Night Side of Nature</cite>, tells a story
reversing this. A gentleman in Germany was dying.
He expressed great desire to see his son, who was
a ne'er-do-well, and was squandering his money in
Paris. At that time the young man was sitting on
a bench in the Bois-de-Boulogne, with a switch in
his hand. Suddenly, he beheld his old father before
him. Convinced that he saw a phantom, he raised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
his switch, and cut the apparition once, twice, and
thrice across the face, and it vanished. At that
moment the dying father uttered a scream, and held
his hands to his face. "My boy! my boy! He is
striking me again&mdash;again!" and he died. The
Algonquin Indians beat the walls of the death-chamber
to drive out the ghost. In Sumatra a priest
is employed with a broom to sweep the ghost out.
In Scotland and in North Germany the chairs on
which a coffin has rested are reversed, lest the dead
man should take a fancy to sit on them instead of
going to his grave. In ancient Mexico certain professional
ghost ejectors were employed, who, after
a funeral, were invited to visit and thoroughly explore
the house whence the dead had been removed,
and if they found the ghost lurking about in corners,
in cupboards, under beds&mdash;anywhere, to kick it out.
In Siberia, after forty days' "law" given to the ghost,
if it be still found loafing about, the Schaman is sent
for, who drums it out. He extorts brandy, which
he professes to require, as he has to personally
conduct the deceased to the land of spirits, where
he will make it and the other ghosts so fuddled that
they will forget the way back to earth.</p>

<p>In North Germany a troublesome ghost is bagged,
and the bag is emptied in some lone spot, or in the
garden of a neighbour against whom a grudge is
entertained.</p>

<p>Another mode of getting rid of the spirit of the
dear departed is to confuse it as to its way home.
This is done in various ways. Sometimes the road
by which it has been carried to its resting-place is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
swept to efface the footprints, and a false track is
made into a wood or on to a moor so that the ghost
may take the wrong road. Sometimes ashes are
strewn on the way to hide the footprints. Sometimes
the dead is carried rapidly three or four times
round the house so as to make him giddy and not
know in which direction he is carried.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The universal
practice of closing the eyes of the dead may
be taken to have originated in the desire that he
might be prevented from seeing his way.</p>

<p>In places it was, as already said, customary for the
dead body to be taken out of the house, not through
the door, but by a hole knocked in the wall for the
purpose, and backwards. In Corea, blinders made of
black silk are put on the dead man's eyes, to prevent
him from finding his way home.</p>

<p>Many savage nations entirely abandon a hut or
a camp in which a death has occurred for precisely
the same reason&mdash;of throwing the dead man's spirit
into confusion as to its way home.</p>

<p>It was a common practice in England till quite
recently for the room in which a death had occurred
to be closed for some time, and this is merely a
survival of the custom of abandoning the place
where a spirit has left the body. The Esquimaux
take out their dying relatives to huts constructed
of blocks of ice or snow, and leave them there to
expire, for ghosts are as stupid as they are troublesome;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
they have no more wits than a peacock, they
can only find their way to the place where they died.</p>

<p>Other usages are to divert a stream and bury the
corpse in the river-bed, or lay it beyond running
water, which, according to ghost-lore, it cannot pass.
Or, again, fires are lighted across its path, and it
shrinks from passing through flames. As for water,
ghosts loathe it. Among the Matamba negroes a
widow is flung into the water and dipped repeatedly
so as to wash off the ghost of the dead husband,
which is supposed to be clinging to her. In New
Zealand, among the Maoris, all who have followed
the corpse dive into water so as to throw off the
ghost which is sneaking home after them. In Tahiti,
all who have assisted at a burial run as hard as they
can to the sea and take headers into it for the same
object. It is the same in New Guinea. We see the
same idea reduced to a mere form in ancient Rome,
where, in place of the dive through water, a vessel
of water was carried twice round those who had
followed the corpse, and they were sprinkled. The
custom of washing for purification after a funeral
practised by the Jews is a reminiscence of the usage,
with a novel explanation given to it.</p>

<p>In the South Pacific, in the Hervey Islands, after a
death, men turn out to pummel and fight the returning
spirit, and give it a good drubbing in the air.</p>

<p>Now perhaps the reader may have been brought
to understand what the sundry mourning costumes
originally meant. They were disguises whereby to
deceive the ghosts, so that they might not recognise
and pester with their undesired attentions the rela<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>tives
who live. Indians who are wont to paint themselves
habitually, go after a funeral totally un-bedecked
with colour. On the other hand, other savages daub
themselves fantastically with various colours, making
themselves as unlike to what they were previously as
is possible. The Coreans, when in mourning, assume
hats with low rims that conceal their features.</p>

<p>The Papuans conceal themselves under extinguishers
made of banana leaves. Elsewhere in New
Guinea they envelop themselves in a wicker-work
frame in which they can hardly walk. Among the
Mpongues of Western Africa, those who on ordinary
occasions wear garments, when suffering bereavement
walk in complete nudity. Valerius Maximus tells
us that among the Lycians it was customary in
mourning for the men to disguise themselves in
women's garments.</p>

<p>The custom of cutting the hair short, and of
scratching and disfiguring the face, and of rending
the garments, all originated from the same thought&mdash;to
make the survivors unrecognisable by the ghost
of the deceased. Plutarch asserts that the Sacæ,
after a death, went down into pits and hid themselves
for days from the light of the sun. Australian
widows near the north-west bend of the Murray
shave their heads and plaster them with pipe-clay,
which, when dry, forms a close-fitting skull-cap. The
spirit of the late lamented, on returning to his better
half, either does not recognise his spouse, or is so
disgusted with her appearance that he leaves her for
ever.</p>

<p>There is almost no end to the expedients adopted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
for getting rid of the dead. Piles of stones are
heaped over them, they are buried deep in the earth,
they are walled up in natural caves, they are inclosed
in megalithic structures, they are burned, they are
sunk in the sea. They are threatened, they are
cajoled, they are hoodwinked. Every sort of trickery
is had recourse to throw them off the scent of home
and to displease them with their living relations.</p>

<p>The wives, horses, dogs slain and buried with
them, the copious supplies of food and drink laid
on their graves, are bribes to induce them to be
content with their situation. Nay, further, in very
many places no food may be eaten in the house of
mourning for many days after an interment. The
object, of course, is to disappoint the returning spirit,
which comes seeking a meal, finds none; comes again
next day, finds none again; and after a while out of
sheer disgust desists from returning.</p>

<p>A vast amount of misdirected ingenuity is expended
in bamboozling and bullying the unhappy
ghosts; but the feature most striking in these proceedings
is the unanimous agreement in considering
these ghosts as such imbeciles. When they put off
their outward husk, they divest themselves of all
that cunning which is the form that intelligence
takes in the savage. Not only so, but, although they
remember and crave after home comforts, they absolutely
forget the tricks they had themselves played
on the souls of the dead in their own lifetime; they
walk and blunder into the traps which they had
themselves laid for other ghosts in the days of their
flesh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps the lowest abyss of dunderheadedness
they have been supposed to reach is when made to
mistake their own identity. Recently, near Mentone,
a series of prehistoric interments in caves has been
exposed. They reveal the dead men as having had
their heads daubed over with red oxide of iron.
Still extant races of savages paint, plaster, and disfigure
their dead. The prehistoric Greeks masked
them. The Aztecs masked their deceased kings, and
the Siamese do so still. We cannot say with absolute
certainty what the object is, but we are probably not
far out when we conjecture the purpose to be to make
the dead forget who they are when they look at their
reflection in the water. There was a favourite song
sung some sixty years ago relative to a little old
woman who got "muzzy." Whilst in this condition
some naughty boys cut her skirts at her knees. When
she woke up and saw her condition, "Lawk!" said
the little old woman, "this never is me!" And
certain ancient peoples treated their dead in something
the same way; they disguised and disfigured
them so that each ghost on waking up might exclaim,
"Lawk! this never is me!" And so, having
lost its identity, the soul did not consider that it
had a right to revisit its old home and molest its old
acquaintances.</p>

<p class="drop-capw"><span class="smcap">As</span> I have already said, the inhabitants of Dartmoor
in prehistoric times seem to have been
of a peaceable disposition. There are pounds to
contain cattle and protect them against wolves, but
no camps on the moor itself. What camps there
are will be found on its confines, as though the
natives feared attack from an enemy outside, but
were not troubled by their neighbours of the same
blood and pursuits.</p>

<p>Of camps there are two sorts, but we cannot be
sure that they belong to different races of men.
The stone-walled fortresses are few&mdash;Brent Tor, Whit
Tor, Cranbrook, one near Ashburton, and the Dewerstone.
Of earth, or earth and stone mixed, there
are more. A small one above Tavistock, an immense
and very important one at Galford or Burleigh in
Bridestowe, one above the station at Okehampton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
Wooston and Prestonbury on the Teign, Holne and
Hembury on the Dart. Along the south of the
moor are none till we reach Boringdon, between
the Plym and the Tory. But one only of all these
has been systematically explored, and that is,
perhaps, the finest, on Whit Tor, above Mary and
Peter Tavy.</p>

<p>Whit Tor rises to the height of 1,526 feet above
the sea-level. It is on Cudlipptown Down, and
commands exceedingly fine views westward as far
as the distant Cornish hills.</p>

<p>The tor is not of granite, but of gabbro, an eruptive
igneous rock, very black and hard, and splitting
along defined planes under the action of the weather.
The north side near the summit is covered with a
clitter of broken masses.</p>

<p>The boldest masses of rock rise on the south
precipitously, but there are fangs of rock that shoot
up over the small plateau that forms the summit
of the hill.</p>

<p>The whole of the summit is surrounded by a
double wall in a very ruinous condition, and this
is to a considerable extent due to the smallness of
the stones of which it was composed. The faces
of the walls were to be traced only by digging,
and were never more than doubtful.</p>

<p>Both walls appear to have been 10 feet thick,
perhaps a little more; the outer, when perfect, might
have had a height of 4 to 4½ feet, whilst the inner,
judged by the débris, appears to have been 6 to
7 feet high.</p>

<p>The space between the walls varied, owing to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
inequalities of the ground, but was generally 10 feet
wide.</p>

<p>The area inclosed by the innermost wall amounts
to close on one and a half acres; the total amount
included within the outer wall is about two and a
half acres of ground.</p>

<p>The circumference is very much broken up, as is
also the inclosed area, by considerable masses of
protruding rocks. About these, within the camp,
heaps of small stones had been piled up, forming
cairns. The largest and most notable of these is at
the south-west, and consists of a core of rock about
which an immense accumulation of stones has been
heaped. All these cairns were thoroughly explored.
They covered no interments, and although they disclosed
evidences that fires had been lighted against
the rocks, and that people had camped there for a
while, they showed no tokens of structural erection,
as though they were ruinous huts built against the
native rock. The huge cairn was removed with great
labour, and revealed nothing whatever beneath it
but one flint flake.</p>

<p>These cairns, there can be little doubt, were collections
of stones for the use of the besieged, to
serve as missiles, or for the repair of the walls.</p>

<p>Within the area of the camp are a few hut circles.
One near the centre is double, and contained an
incredible number of flint chips, a flint scraper, and
a core from which flakes had been struck. The
whole area is littered with flint chips that are brought
up by the moles when making their burrows, and
curiously enough not a single arrow-head or flake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
that can be confidently set down as a weapon has
been disinterred. The pottery found is all of the
hand-made cooking-vessel type.</p>

<p>To the east is a circle sheltered on one side by
a mass of rock, that has a second chamber, a sort of
bedroom made under a slab of rock, with the
interstices on all sides built up, except only on that
by which it was entered from the hut. A good deal
of flint was found there. Outside, on the south, was
another hut circle, where a piece of clear quartz
crystal was found, together with a flint knife that
had one edge serrated by use.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/p100.jpg" width="700" height="367" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>COVERED CHAMBER AND COOKING-HOLE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Connected with the camp on the north-east is a
ruined wall that leads to an inclosure with numerous
hut circles. South-west of the camp further down
the hill is a pound in good preservation with eight
hut circles in it. A reeve or bank to the west of
the camp leads down to other collections of habitations
of the same description.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption"><p>CONSTRUCTION OF STONE AND TIMBER WALL.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Some ten cairns on the slopes have been investigated,
but have yielded little beyond the handful
of ashes sunk in a pit in the centre that represents
the dead. A ruined kistvaen, much mutilated, lies
between the camp and the Langstone, a menhir that
gives its name to the common, and which is the
starting-point of a stone row of very inconsiderable
blocks that led to a cairn now demolished, and its
place occupied by a pool. From Langstone a track
to the south-east leads by the head of the Peter
Tavy stream, which rises in a bog, to a fine circle
of standing stones, and on the slope below that and
above the Walkham river is a large settlement of
some thirty or forty habitations. Beyond the Peter
Tavy brook, moreover, are numerous clusters of
dwellings. To all the population who lived in these
huts, Whit Tor had served as a camp of refuge. The
place deserves a visit, for we have there collected
within a small radius the houses and hamlets occupied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
by the primeval race, the tombs of their dead, the
stone row set up in memory of some chief represented
by the Longstone towering above the petty
stones below, the circle in which the dead were
burned, and finally, the camp to which they flew to
defend their beloved moor from invasion.</p>

<p>It may cause some surprise that the walls of the
stone castles should be in such complete ruin. But,
in all likelihood, they were constructed on the same
principle as the Gaulish camps described by Cæsar.
They were built of timber frames packed in with
stones, and the logs mortised together held the
stones in place. When, however, the wood rotted,
this mode of construction ensured and precipitated
utter ruin. At Murcens, in the department of Lot,
is one of these stone camps, and sufficiently well
preserved, owing to the size of the limestone slabs
employed in the building, to show precisely how
the whole was constructed. But the walls of Iosolodunum,
that held out so bravely against Cæsar, being
built of small stones compacted with timber, are
now but heaps of ruin, no better than those of Whit
Tor.</p>

<p>Brent Tor was fortified in a manner very similar to
Whit Tor; the outer wall remains fairly perfect on
the north side, but the inner wall has been much
injured. In this instance it is not the summit, but
the base of the hill that has been defended. As
there is a church on the summit, as also a churchyard
with its wall, these have drawn their supplies
from the circumvallation. Moreover, it has been
broken through to form a way up to the church.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/p103.jpg" width="700" height="468" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>BRENT TOR</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>A late curate of Tavistock, whose function it was
to take the service on Brent Tor, and who found it
often desperate work to scramble to the summit
in storm and sleet and rain, resolved on forming a
roadway to the churchyard gate. But he experienced
some difficulty in persuading men to go out from
Tavistock to work at this churchway. However, he
supplied himself with several bottles of whisky, and
when he saw a sturdy labourer standing idle in the
market-place he invited him into his lodgings and
plied him with hot grog, till the man in a moist
and smiling condition assented to the proposition
that he should give a day to the Brent Tor path. By
this means it was made. The curate was wont to
say: "Hannibal cut his way through the Alps with
vinegar; I hewed mine over Brent Tor with prime
usquebaugh." Few traces of this way remain, but
in making it sad mischief was made with the inner
wall of the fortress.</p>

<p>On Brent Tor summit it is sometimes impossible to
stand against the wind. I remember how that on
one occasion a baptismal party mounted it in driving
rain. The father carried the child, and he wore for
the occasion a new blue jersey. When the poor
babe was presented at the font it was not only
streaming with water, but its sopped white garments
had become blue with the stain from the father's
jersey.</p>

<p>On an occasion of a funeral, when the parson
emerged from the church door he was all but
prostrated by the north-west blast, and he and the
funeral party had to proceed to the grave much like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
frogs. "Crook'y down, sir!" was the sexton's advice;
and the whole company had to press forward bent
double, and to finish the service seated in the "lew"
of headstones.</p>

<p>According to popular belief the graves, which are
cut in the volcanic tufa, fill with water, and the
dead dissolve into a sort of soup. But this is not
true; the rock is dry and porous. It discharges its
drainage by a little spring on the north-east that
in process of ages has worked itself from stage to
stage lower down the hill.</p>

<p>The Dewerstone Camp consists of two stone walls
drawn across the headland. No walls were needed
for the sides that were precipitous. Cranbrook
Castle is in very good preservation, except on the
side towards the Teign, where it has been removed
by road-menders, but not within recent years. It
richly deserves to be investigated, and the owners
have recently granted permission to do so to the
Dartmoor Exploration Committee.</p>

<p>We come next to the earthen-banked camps. Of
these there is a very fine example at Hembury,
near Buckfastleigh. But the finest of all is in
Burleigh Wood, in the parish of Bridestowe. Here
the side accessible from Galford Down has been cut
through, with a trench and a bank thrown up on
the camp side, and this is carried right across the
neck. The earthen banks were almost certainly
crested with palisades. Hard by this early camp,
where a bronze palstave has been found, is another
of a different character, occupying the extreme point
of the hill. This consists of a tump or mound, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
an earthwork round it as a ring. In this are remains
of iron-smelting.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt as to the period of this
latter. It was the <em>burrh</em> of the Anglo-Saxon, and
was in every point similar to the <em>mottes</em> of the
Merovingians in France. On the Bayeux tapestry
three fortified places are represented&mdash;Dinan, Dol,
and Rennes&mdash;and all are of the same type. A mound
of earth was either thrown up, or a hilltop was
artificially shaped like a tumulus. On the top of
this the <em>thegn</em> erected his fortress of wood. In the
Bayeux representations the superstructures at Dol
and Rennes are of timber, and that of Dinan is
partly of timber and partly of stone. A flying
bridge of wood led from the gate in the palisading
of the outer ring, supported on posts, and conducted
by an incline to the gate of the citadel. An example
of one of these camps at Bishopston in Gower has
been explored recently.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The stumps of the pales
were there found embedded in the clay of the bank,
in tolerable preservation.</p>

<p>In the valley below Burleigh Camp, commanding
the ancient road from Exeter by Okehampton to
Launceston, was a third camp, that has been for
the most part obliterated; it occupied a rising knoll
of limestone, and this latter has been quarried, so
that the camp earthworks have been either destroyed
or buried under the accumulations from the quarry.</p>

<p>The locality is of great interest. The ridge goes
by the name of Galford, and there is reason to think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
that this was the Gavulford of the Anglo-Saxon
Chronicle, where, in 823, the Britons made their last
stand against Egbert and the Saxons of Devon.</p>

<p>The place is by nature very strong, and it dominates
two roads, that from Exeter to Cornwall, and
that which branched off from it on Sourton Down
and struck through Sourton to Lydford. The name
Gavulford signifies the holdfast on the <em>fordd</em> or road.</p>

<p>Burleigh Camp is on the estate of Bidlake, an
interesting old manor house, long the residence of
a family of the same name, and deserving a visit.
Old Squire Bidlake was a zealous Royalist, and the
Parliamentary soldiers went to his house to seize
him. As they entered the avenue they met an
elderly tramp in rags, and said, "You fellow. Have
you seen Squire Bidlake?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied; "I've just come from the house,
and when I was there he was in it."</p>

<p>Then he went his way, and not till too late did
they discover that this tramp was Squire Bidlake
himself slipping away in disguise.</p>

<p>He fled to Burleigh Wood. There is a little farm
below it, in which, at the time, lived a tenant of the
name of Veale. Veale and his wife and daughter
concealed him in the underwood, and daily conveyed
to him food, and supplied him with blankets till the
search for him ceased.</p>

<p>At the Restoration, Squire Bidlake made over the
farm to the Veales on a nominal rent, to be held by
them on this rent so long as a male Veale of their
descent remained to hold it.</p>

<p>Both Bidlakes and Veales are now gone, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
little farmhouse is a ruin. Squire Bidlake is supposed
still to haunt the wood, and children are
frightened by their mothers with the threat that
the old squire will come and fetch them, if naughty.</p>

<p>Lydford was strongly defended. It occupies a
fringe of land between ravines, and lines of fortification
were drawn across the neck. These may still
be traced. The castle stands on a tump artificially
shaped. Beyond the church is another small camp,
probably British. The castle itself is a structure of
stone, replacing the old Saxon <em>burrh</em>.</p>

<p>It was probably from the bridges leading up into
these citadels, which the Norsemen saw when they
harried our coasts, that they conceived the idea that
the rainbow was the great bridge leading up into
Odin's Valhalla.</p>

<p>"What fools the gods must be," says the inquirer
in the Edda, "to build their passage of egress and
ingress of such brittle stuff."</p>

<p class="drop-capw"><span class="smcap">No</span> one who has eyes in his head, and considers
what he sees, if he has been on Dartmoor, can
have failed to observe how that every stream-bed
has been turned over, and how that every hollow
in a hillside is furrowed.</p>

<p>The tin-streamers who thus scarred the face of the
moor carried on their works far down below where
the rivers debouch from the moor on to the lowlands,
but there the evidences of their toil have been effaced
by culture.</p>

<p>The tin found in the detritus of streams is the
oxide, and is far purer than tin found in the lode.
Mining for tin was pursued on Dartmoor during the
Middle Ages to a limited extent only, and solely
when the stream tin was exhausted.</p>

<p>A very interesting excursion may be made from
Douseland Station up the Meavy valley to Nosworthy
Bridge, above which several old tin-moulds may be
seen lying in the track beside the river, and tin-workings
are passed. But perhaps the most interesting
portion of the walk is that up the Nillacombe
that opens on to the Meavy from the right below
Kingset.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>TIN-WORKINGS, NILLACOMBE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Above this the stream has been turned about and
its bed torn up, and rubble heaped in huge piles.
Not only so, but the hill-slope to the south is marked
as with confluent smallpox, the result of the gropings
of miners after tin. They followed up every trickle
from the side and dug <em>costeening</em>, or <em>shoding</em>, pits
everywhere in search of metal.</p>

<p>The upper waters of the Webburn have in like
manner been explored, and some idea of the extent
to which the moor was lacerated by the miners may
be obtained from the Warren Inn on the road<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
from Post Bridge to Moreton, looking east, when the
slopes of Headland Warren and Challacombe will be
seen seamed deeply.</p>

<p>The remains of the tinners have not been subjected
to as full an exploration as they merit, but certain
results have nevertheless been reached. One thing
is abundantly clear, that all the tin-streaming was
done subsequently to the time when men occupied
the hut circles. The population living in them
knew nothing of tin.</p>

<p>Diodorus Siculus, who wrote <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 8, says that the
dwellers at Belerium, a cape of Britain, mined and
smelted tin. "After beating it up into knucklebone
shapes they carry it to a certain island lying off
Britain, named Ictis, for at ebb tides, the space
between drying up, they carry the tin in waggons
thither ... and thence the merchants buy it from
the inhabitants and carry it over to Gaul, and lastly,
travelling by land through Gaul about thirty days,
they bring down the loads on horses to the mouth
of the Rhine."</p>

<p>There can exist little doubt that Ictis is the same
as Vectis, the Isle of Wight. It is held that anciently
the island was connected with the mainland. The
Roman station and harbour was at Brading. The
early workers first pounded the ore with stone
crushers, and such have been found. They then
fanned it in the wind, which carried off the fine
light dust, and left the metal on the shovels on
which they tossed the ore and grit into the air.
Beside some of the workings heaps of this dust
have been detected. The washing of the ore came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
later. When sufficient had been collected, long
troughs were sunk in the "calm," or native clay,
and these were filled with charcoal; then the tin
ore was laid on this charcoal, and either more of
this latter was heaped above, or else peat was piled
up, with layers of ore. Finally the whole was
kindled. No bellows were used, but a draught
through the channel kept the whole glowing, and
the metal ran through the fire into the bottom of
the hollow, or ran out at the end, as this rude
furnace was constructed on an incline.</p>

<p>In Staffordshire, at Kinver, and in the neighbourhood
of Stourbridge, in Worcestershire, I have seen
banks and hedges made up of what are locally called
<em>burrs</em>. These consist of masses of sand and iron
slag, two feet in diameter, round, and concave on one
side, convex on the other. These burrs were formed
in the primitive manufacture of iron, which much
resembled that of tin. Andrew Yarranton, in <cite>England's
Improvement by Sea and Land</cite>, 1698, says that
he saw dug up near the walls of Worcester the
hearth of an old Roman iron-furnace.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It was an open hearth upon which was placed alternately
charcoal and ironstone, to which fire being applied;
it was urged by men treading upon bellows. The operation
was very slow and imperfect. Unless the ore was very
rich, not more than one hundredweight of iron could be
extracted in a day. The ironstone did not melt, but was
found at the bottom of the hearth in a large lump or
bloom, which was afterwards taken out and beaten under
massive hammers previous to its being worked into the
required shape or form."</p></div>

<p>The <em>burrs</em> found are the sand and iron mixed that
encased the <em>bloom</em>, which was taken out by pincers
and worked on the anvil. The scoria that encased
the bloom was thrown aside, and yet contains more
than one-half of iron. The iron reduced in this
simple manner never ran, but it became soft like
dough, and could be removed and beaten into
shape.</p>

<p>The method of dealing with the tin was similar,
only that in this latter case the metal flowed. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
foot bellows were employed before the system of
working bellows, and producing a continuous blast
by means of a water-wheel, is most probable. The
foot bellows are known to most primitive people,
but in Agricola's illustration of the smelting of tin
none are shown. On the contrary, Æolus is represented
in the corner as blowing a natural blast.</p>

</div>

<p>The book of Agricola, published in 1556, shows
that this primitive method was still in practice so
late as the middle of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>But this clumsy method could not be long practised
on Dartmoor, where fuel&mdash;except peat&mdash;was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
scarce; and it gave way to a furnace of better construction,
where the receiver was circular, and a
draught-hole was at the bottom. One of these has
been dug out and carefully examined at Deep Swincombe.</p>

<p>It consists of a single chamber, 18 feet by 11 feet,
rudely constructed of masses of granite resting on
one another by their own weight and unset in mortar
or in clay. The entrance was narrow and low. On
one side was the furnace, constructed of granite, one
slab set upright to form a side, and the back and
other side built up rudely. A fragment of the
receptacle for the molten tin was found, with a
receiver and channel cut in it. Pottery was also
found, which was of a very early description. It
was submitted to the late Sir Wollaston Franks, of
the British Museum, who said that he would have
attributed it to the Celtic period but for the bold
scores made at the starting-point of a handle, which
are characteristic of Anglo-Saxon pottery.</p>

<p>At the extremity furthest from the door was a
<em>cache</em> in the thickness of the wall, formed something
like a kistvaen, as a place in which to store the metal
and tools. The whole structure was banked up with
rubble and turf.</p>

<p>Outside to the south still lies a mould-stone, a slab
of elvan, in which the mould had been cut, measuring
26 inches long by 12 inches at one end and 15 at the
other, and 5 inches deep.</p>

<p>That this is the earliest tin-furnace yet discovered
on Dartmoor admits of no doubt. The curious mould-stone
is quite different in shape from any others
found on the moor. No mortar-stones were discovered,
and this also is a token of antiquity.</p>

<p>The earliest smelting arrangements must have
been very crude, and much tin was left in the slag.
Until recently the Malays threw away their slags,
which contained as much as 40 per cent. of tin. As
there have been no mortar-stones found at Deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
Swincombe, it is to be presumed that the tinners
disregarded their slags. These have not, moreover,
been found. The reason was this&mdash;the sets had been
reworked at a later time by the tinners at Gobbetts,
further down the river. These later men had stone
mortars and a crazing mill, and finding these rich
slags, removed them, pounded them up in the
hollowed mortar-stones, that may be seen <i lang="la">in situ</i>
at Gobbetts, and re-smelted them. Deep Swincombe
has all the appearance of having been much pulled
about by tinners since the first furnace was erected.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>TIN-MOULD, DEEP SWINCOMBE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The tin running out of the furnace was allowed to
flow into holes in the ground, and thence was ladled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
whilst in a molten condition and poured into the
moulds.</p>

<p>Mr. Gowland has given a most interesting account
of the manner in which the metals are extracted from
their ores in Japan.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> This shows how that the
primitive methods are still in practice there. He
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Although tin ore is found and worked in Japan in
several localities, there is but one ancient mine in the
country. It is situated in Taniyama, in the province of
Satsuma. The excavations of the old miners here are of
a most extensive character, the hillsides in places being
literally honeycombed by their burrows, indicating the
production in past times of large quantities of the metal.
No remains, however, have been found to give any clue
to the date of the earliest workings. But whatever may
have been their date, the processes and appliances of the
early smelters could not have been more primitive than
those I found in use when I visited the mines in 1883.</p>

<p>"The ore was roughly broken up by hammers on stone
anvils, then reduced to a coarse powder with the pounders
used for decorticating rice, the mortars being large blocks
of stone with roughly hollowed cavities.</p>

<p>"It was finally ground in stone querns, and washed by
women in a stream to remove the earthy matter and foreign
minerals with which it was contaminated. The furnace in
which the ore was smelted is exactly the same as that used
for copper ores, excepting that it is somewhat less in
diameter. The ore was charged into it wet, in alternate
layers with charcoal, and the process was conducted in
precisely the same way as in smelting oxidised copper ores.
The tin obtained was laded out of the furnace into moulds
of clay."</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>
<p>The furnace employed for copper is also described
by Mr. Gowland:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"An excavation, measuring about 4 feet long, 4 feet wide,
and 2 feet deep, is made, and this is filled with dry clay
carefully beaten down. In the centre of this bed of clay
a shallow, conical-shaped hole is scooped out. The hole is
then lined with a layer, about three inches thick, of damp
clay mixed with charcoal, and the furnace is complete.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/p119.jpg" width="700" height="548" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>SMELTING TIN IN JAPAN.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"It has no apertures either for the injection of the blast
or for tapping out the metal. A blast of air is supplied to
it generally from two bellows, placed behind a wall of wattle
well coated with clay, by which they and the men working
them are protected from the heat. The blast is led from
each bellows by a bamboo tube, terminating in a very long
nozzle of clay, which rests on the edge of the furnace cavity."</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>At Deep Swincombe no bellows were used; the
draught probably came in through the hole behind
the furnace.</p>

<p>But in the reign of Queen Elizabeth a great revolution
in the smelting of tin was wrought by the
introduction of German workmen and their improved
methods. They brought in the water-wheel. The
ruins that are found in such abundance of "blowing-houses,"
as they are called&mdash;one at the least beside
every considerable stream&mdash;belong, for the most part,
to the Elizabethan period. They have their "leats"
for carrying water to them, and their pits for tiny
wheels that worked the bellows.</p>

<p>The situation of these smelting-houses may be
found usually by the mould-stones that lie near them.
There is one below the slide or fall of the Yealm,
with its moulds in and by it, and another just above
the fall. There is one near the megalithic remains at
Drizzlecombe, also with its mould-stones. But it
is unnecessary to particularise when they are so
numerous. I will, however, quote Mr. R. Burnard's
description of two in the Walkham valley as typical:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The first is about 250 yards above Merrivale Bridge,
on the left bank of the river. One jamb is erect, and, like
most of the doorways of Dartmoor blowing-houses, was
low, and to be entered necessitated an almost all-fours
posture. Very little of the walls is standing, but what
remains is composed of large moor-stones, dry laid. Near
the entrance is a stone, 3 feet long and 2½ feet wide,
containing a mould, which at the top is 18 inches long,
13 inches wide, and 6 inches deep. The sides are bevelled,
so that the bottom length is 12½ inches, with a width of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
7 inches at one end and 8 inches at the other. One end
of the mould has a narrow gutter leading from the top to
halfway down the mould. This was probably used for the
insertion of a piece of iron prior to the metal being run in,
thus permitting the easy withdrawal of the block of tin
when cool from the mould. This stone also contains a
small bevelled ingot or sample mould, 4 inches long, 2
inches wide, and 1¼ inches deep.</p>

<p>"A water-wheel probably stood in the eastern recess of
the house, for there is a covered drain leading from here
right under the house and out at the western end, where
the water was discharged into the river. Traces of the
leat which supplied the motive power to this wheel may
also be seen.</p>

<p>"What appear to be the remains of the furnace, consisting
of massive stones placed vertically, and inclosing
a small rectangular space, are plainly visible. In this
place, lying askew, as if it had been thrown out of position,
is a large stone containing a long, shallow cavity, which
may have been the bottom of the furnace or 'float,' <em>i.e.</em>
the cavity in which the molten tin collected before being
ladled into the mould.</p>

<p>"This ruin lies at the nether end of deep, open cuttings,
which start from near Rundlestone Corner, and are continued
right down to the Walkham.</p>

<p>"About 1,000 yards up stream is the ruin of the other
blowing-house, with remains of a wheel-pit and a leat.
There is also a stone containing a mould 16 inches long
at the top, 11 inches wide, and 6 inches deep. It is
bevelled, so that the bottom length is 12½ inches, with a
width of 8 inches. Like the mould-stone in the ruin below,
it contains a sample ingot mould 3½ inches long,
3 inches wide, and 2 inches deep. The remains in these
ruins are very similar to each other, and these blowing-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>houses
were probably smelting during the same period,
indicating that a considerable quantity of tin was raised
in their neighbourhood."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p></div>

<p>Anciently, before the introduction of the wheel,
the smelting-place above all others was at King's
Oven, or Furnum Regis, near the Warren Inn, between
Post Bridge and Moreton. It is mentioned
in the <cite>Perambulation of Dartmoor</cite>, made in 1240. It
consists of a circular inclosure of about seventy-two
yards in diameter, forming a pound, with the remains
of a quadrangular building in it. The furnace itself
was destroyed some years ago. When the inclosure
was made it was carried to a cairn that was in part
demolished, to serve to form the bank of the pound.
This cairn was ringed about with upright stones, and
contained a kistvaen. The latter was rifled, and
most of the stones removed to form the walls; but
a few of the inclosing uprights were not meddled
with, and between two was found firmly wedged
a beautiful flint scraper.</p>

<p>As the drift tin was exhausted, and the slag of the
earlier miners was used up, it became necessary to
run adits for tin, and work the veins. These adits
remain in several places, and where they have been
opened have yielded up iron bars and picks. But
these are not more ancient than mediæval times,
probably late in them. That gold was found in the
granite rubble of the stream-beds is likely. A model
of a gold-washing apparatus was found on the moor
a few years ago. It was made of zinc.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>
<p>According to an old Irish historical narrative, a
bard was wont to carry a wand of "white bronze"
or tin, and his shoes were also tin-plated.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> One
wonders whether at any time a bard thus shod and
with his rod of office strode over Dartmoor and
chanted historic ballads there!</p>

<p>For such as would care to see these dry bones of
antiquarian research into the past of tin-streamers
clothed with flesh, I must refer them to my novel of
<cite>Guavas the Tinner</cite>, in which I have described the
mode of life of the metal-seekers on the moor in the
time of Elizabeth.</p>

<p class="drop-capw"><span class="smcap">Fifty</span> years ago Lydford was one of the most
out-of-the-world and wild spots in England.
I had almost written God-forsaken, but checked my
pen, for God forsakes no place, though He may tarry
to bless. There were no resident gentry&mdash;there never
had been, as a glance at the registers reveals. There
was no resident rector&mdash;there had not been within
the memory of the oldest inhabitant. The rector
was a wealthy pluralist, rector of Southill and
Callington, in Cornwall, who hardly ever showed his
face in Lydford, the largest parish in England, and
maintained a poor curate there on a hundred pounds
a year in a miserable cottage.</p>

<p>The people were a law to themselves, and had the
credit of being inveterate poachers.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

<div class="caption"><p>ON THE LYD</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>The houses, thatched, built of moor-stones, not set
in mortar, were in a ruinous condition. The aspect
of the place was that of an Irish village. It was
dominated by a ruined castle, and possessed a church
fast lapsing to ruin, and was girt in by walls long
ago reduced to heaps. One Christmas Day the
curate went to the church for the celebration of the
Holy Communion, and found the altar covered with
snow that had blown in through the battered east
window and under the cracked slates of the roof.</p>

<p>"I'll sweep it off," said the clerk.</p>

<p>"On no account. God has spread His table," said
the curate; and he celebrated on the white sheet of
snow.</p>

<p>In the cottage that served as parsonage it was not
much better. The curate had two rooms downstairs
and one above. One room was slate-paved. Upstairs
there was no ceiling, and he had occasionally
to spread his umbrella over his head and pillow when
he went to bed.</p>

<p>Now all is changed, or changing.</p>

<p>The church has been restored, and is a model of
what a church should be. The old parsonage has
been pulled down, and stables built on the site, and
the late Mr. Street, the architect, erected an absurd
Scottish castle with angle turrets and extinguisher
caps to serve as rectory. The ruinous houses are
being replaced by trim, if ugly, habitations. Only
the gaunt castle remains gutted.</p>

<p>About fifty years ago the clerk was addicted to
lifting his elbow too freely, and came to church occasionally
in a hilarious condition. The climax was
reached at a funeral, when he tumbled into the grave
before the coffin, and apostrophised the dead man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
as he scrambled out: "Beg parding, Ted; I bain't
minded to change places wi' you just yet."</p>

<p>The curate was compelled to discharge him and
appoint another, Peter X.</p>

<p>The old clerk refused to accept his dismissal, and
gathered his adherents, and on the ensuing Sunday
marched at their head to the house of God. Peter,
advised of this, summoned his supporters, and,
having the keys, ensconced himself early within the
sacred building, in the clerk's pew, surrounded by
his upholders. The rival party entered, and a battle
ensued between the factions. The curate absolutely
refused to perform the service to the clerking of the
dismissed official, and finally the latter and his gang
were ejected from the church, loudly professing that
they would all turn Dissenters.</p>

<p>This Peter remained clerk for fifty years. He
obtained a subsidiary revenue by carrying children
afflicted with "the thrush" up the tower, and holding
them over the battlements at each pinnacle, whilst
he recited the Lord's Prayer. For this he received
a small gratuity.</p>

<p>He was a most worthy man, and, as he is now
dead, I do not scruple to mention that the story I
have told in <cite>Furze Bloom</cite>, under the title of "Peter
Lempole," pertained to him. He never married, the
reason being that he had a childish old brother
entirely dependent on him. Peter was engaged to
a bright, pretty girl; but one day she said to him,
"When us is married, then, mind y', Peter, I'm not
going to have that silly brother of yourn in the
house with me." "Indeed!" was Peter's retort; "then
into my house <em>you</em> shall never come."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>Lydford occupies a tongue of land between two
ravines, one cleft perpendicularly to a depth of
seventy feet, the other steep, but not sheer through
rock. The old line of fortifications, much degraded
by the plough, may be traced distinctly, nevertheless,
across the only portion of the headland by which
attack was possible. It is the sort of fortress which
goes by the name of cliff castle on the Cornish and
Welsh coasts.</p>

<p>That it was a site chosen by the prehistoric population
is undoubted. Such a natural fortress could
not have been overlooked, and it was held since
remote times till the Normans came. Yet, notwithstanding
the position being almost impregnable, it
was taken, and the town of Lydford was burnt by
the Danes in 997 after they had destroyed the
Abbey of Tavistock. From Domesday it would
appear that at the Conquest Lydford was a walled
town. It sent burgesses to Parliament twice in the
reign of Edward I.</p>

<p>The church is dedicated to S. Petrock, and at its
restoration some remains of the old British church
were discovered three feet below the pavement of the
present edifice. The slabs that had lain on the floor
of the original oratory were taken up and placed
within the doorway of the present church; so that
the worshippers may stand on the very stones on
which their ancestors stood in the sixth century.
That into the walls of the reconstructed church
most of the stones of the original edifice were incorporated,
is more than probable.</p>

<p>There are several Petrock churches round the moor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>&mdash;Harford,
South Brent, Clannaborough; and probably
the original founder and patron of Buckfast
Abbey was this saint.</p>

<p>The great distinction between British foundations
and those that were Roman was this: a British church
was called after its founder, whereas a Roman church
received its name from some scraps of dead bones
of a saint laid under the altar, or placed in it.
Unhappily, we have no record of S. Petrock's labours
in Devon, but there can exist little hesitation in
holding that he was an apostle of the district about
Dartmoor and of a tract north of it as well, as also
that he laboured and died in Cornwall.</p>

<p>Here is what Bede tells us of the manner of consecration
among the Celts. It must be premised
that the historian is speaking of Cedd, Bishop of
the East Saxons from 653 to 664, to whom Oidilvald,
King of the Deisa, had given a piece of land.
Cedd had received his training from Celtic monks at
Iona.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"This man of God, wishing by prayer and fasting to
purge the place of its former pollution of wickedness, and
so to lay the foundation of the monastery, entreated the
king that he would grant him the means and permission
to dwell there for that purpose, during the whole time
of Lent, which was then at hand. In all the days of this
time, except on Sundays, he fasted till the evening, according
to custom, and then took no other sustenance than
a little bread, one hen's egg, and a little milk mixed with
water. This, he said, was the custom of those of whom
he had learned the rule of regular discipline; first to
consecrate to our Lord, by prayer and fasting, the places<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
which they had newly received for building a monastery
or a church.</p>

<p>"When there were ten days of Lent still remaining
there came a messenger to call him to the king, and he,
that the religious work might not be intermitted, on
account of the king's affairs, entreated his priest, Cynebil,
who was also his brother, to complete the work that had
been so piously begun. Cynebil readily complied, and
when the time of fasting and prayer was over he there
built the monastery, which is now called Lastingham."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p></div>

<p>The name Petrock is really Peterkin, the Celtic
diminutive of Peter, and it is probable that Peter
Tavy is another of his foundations, as well as certain
other churches now regarded as dedicated to the
great apostle.</p>

<p>The Saxons, who were saturated with Latin ideas,
when they obtained supremacy, rededicated the
churches to saints of the Roman calendar, if they
were able to obtain from Italy some scraps of bone
that it was pretended had belonged to one of the
saints of the Latin calendar. But there is no evidence
that the British Christians did other than call
their churches after the names of the founders.</p>

<p>Lydford church is of fifteenth-century Perpendicular,
but in the chancel is an earlier piscina, and
the font is possibly pre-Norman. The chancel screen
is gone, but the rood staircase remains.</p>

<p>In the churchyard is the often-quoted epitaph of
George Routleigh:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the churchyard may be noticed some altar
tombs of the type not infrequent round the moor.</p>

<p>Due west of the church, across the graveyard
hedge, is a small camp, possibly British.</p>

<p>The castle is planted on a tump, a natural elevation
artificially shaped, and is not particularly interesting.
It is square, and was built after the Conquest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
By a charter of Edward I. it was constituted a
Stannary prison. Richard Strode, of Newnham Park,
one of the principal gentry of the county, moved in
Parliament to restrain the miners from discharging
their refuse into the rivers with the result of choking
up the harbours. The miners were so incensed
against him that they captured him in 1512, had
him summarily tried by their Stannary Laws, on
Crockern Tor, and threw him into Lydford gaol,
where he languished for some time, and it was with
considerable difficulty that his release was obtained.</p>

<p>What with Forest Laws and Stannary Laws,
Lydford Castle rarely lacked tenants. Even in 1399
Lydford law was held in bad repute, for Wright, in
his collection of political poems, prints some verses
of that date which speak of it as such; and William
Browne, in 1644, wrote on it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I oft have heard of Lydford law,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How in the morn they hang and draw,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And sit in judgment after:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At first I wondered at it much,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But soon I found the matter such<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As it deserves no laughter.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"They have a castle on a hill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I took it for some old wind-mill,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The vanes blown off by weather.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than lie therein one night 'tis guessed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twere better to be stoned or pressed<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or hanged, ere you come thither."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>And so on for sixteen verses.</p>

<p>Below the castle is the water-gate where is the
only spring from which Lydford town was supplied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
till Mr. Radford brought drinking water into the
place.</p>

<p>With Lydford the name of Daniel Radford will
be indissolubly connected&mdash;one of the noblest and
kindest of men, and one of the most modest. He
cut the way up the ravine by which the gorge was
made accessible. When I was a boy the only method
by which it could be explored was by swimming and
scrambling in summer, when the water was low.
Mr. Radford built Bridge House and restored the
church. It was due to him that I undertook, in
1888, to collect the folk-music in Devon and Cornwall;
and it is in Lydford churchyard that he lies,
awaiting the resurrection of the just. Not without
deep feeling can I pen these lines to commemorate
one of the best men whom it has been my happiness
to know.</p>

<p>As I have mentioned the folk-music of Devon,
I may here add that one of my assistants was old
Will Huggins, of Lydford, a mason, who entered
enthusiastically into the work. I had an attack
of influenza in the winter of 1889-90, and had to
leave England for Italy. Before my departure Will
promised me to go about among his old cronies and
collect ancient ballads. Alas! he caught a chill; it
fell on his chest, and when I returned in the spring,
it was to learn that he was gone.</p>

<p>In the village street may be noticed, built into the
hedge or wall, a piece of granite with a round hole
like a rock basin depressed in it. Actually it is one
of the stones of a gate-hinge.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>A PRIMITIVE HINGE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Formerly the gates around Dartmoor had no iron
hinges, but turned in sockets cut in granite blocks.
Few of these now remain in use, but the stones may
be noticed lying about in many places, and it is really
marvellous that the antiquaries of the past did not
suppose they were basins for sacrificial lustration.</p>

<p>In 1880 the late Mr. Lukis was in Devon, planning
the rude stone monuments on Dartmoor for the Royal
Society of Antiquaries. He came on some of these
cuplike holes in stones, and carefully measured and
drew them. Happily, I was able to show a gate
swinging between two of these blocks, and so explain
to him their purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>The Lydford ravine is the finest of its kind in
England. A bridge crosses it, and it is worth while
looking over the parapet into the gulf below, through
which the river writhes and leaps. The gardens
of Bridge House are thrown open on Mondays, when
a visitor may descend and thread the gorge. But
decidedly the best way for him to see the beauties
of the Lyd valley, where most restricted and romantic,
is for him to descend at the waterfall, a pretty but not
grand slide of a lateral brook, and ascend the ravine
of the Lyd from thence; he will pass through the
gorge where finest, under the bridge, and pursue his
course till he comes out at a mill below the south
gate of Lydford. Hence a half-mile will take him to
Kitt's Steps, another fall, a leap of the Lyd into
a basin half choked with the rubbish from a mine.
The mine happily failed, but it has left its heaps in
the glen as a permanent disfigurement.</p>

<p>Considerable caution must be exercised in ascending
the gorge, as the path is narrow, and in places
slippery. A schoolmistress was killed here a few
years ago. She turned to look at the sun glancing
through the leaves at the entrance of the chasm,
became giddy, and fell over. She was dead when her
body was recovered.</p>

<p>Inhabiting the valley and lateral combes of the
Lyd, in the time of Charles I. and the Commonwealth,
was a race of men called the Gubbinses.
They were wild and lawless, and maintained themselves
by stealing sheep and cattle, and carrying them
into the labyrinth of glens where they could not be
traced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>Fuller, in his account of the wonders of the county
of Devon, includes the Gubbinses. He heard of them
during his stay in Exeter, 1644-7.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I have read of an England beyond Wales, but the
Gubbings land is a Scythia within England, and they be
pure heathens therein. It lyeth near Brenttor, in the edge
of Dartmore.... They are a peculiar of their own making,
exempt from Bishop, Archdeacon, and all Authority, either
ecclesiastical or civil. They live in cotts (rather holes than
houses) like swine, having all in common, multiplied, without
marriage, into many hundreds. Their language is the
drosse of the dregs of the vulgar Devonian; and the more
learned a man is, the worse he can understand them. Their
wealth consists in other men's goods, and they live by
stealing the sheep on the More, and vain it is for any to
search their Houses, being a Work beneath the pains of a
Sheriff, and above the powers of any constable. Such
their fleetness, they will out-run many horses: vivaciousnesse,
they outlive most men, living in the ignorance of
luxury, the Extinguisher of Life, they hold together like
Burrs, offend One, and All will revenge his quarrel."</p></div>

<p>William Browne speaks of them as near Lydford:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And near thereto's the Gubbins' cave,<br /></span>

</div></div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>
<p>It cannot be said that the race is altogether extinct.
The magistrates have had much trouble with certain
persons living in hovels on the outskirts of the moor,
who subsist in the same manner. They carry off
lambs and young horses before they are marked, and
when it is difficult, not to say impossible, for the
owners to identify them. Their own ewes always
have doubles.</p>

<p>In the West Okement valley, in a solitary spot,
are the foundations of a cottage in which for many
years a man lived, preying upon the flocks and cattle
on the moor, and carrying on his depredations with
such cunning that he was never caught. It was
shrewdly suspected that he was in league with a
number of small farmers, and that he was by this
means able to pass on his captures and ensure their
concealment.</p>

<p>Black Down is an extensive ridge of moorland
traversed by the high road from Okehampton to
Tavistock. The highest point is called Gibbet Hill,
but tradition is silent as to who hung there.</p>

<p>In the Mary Tavy register occurs this entry:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"1691, March 12, William Warden, a currier, was
whipped by the Parson and Churchwardens of Whitchurch,
and ordered to be passed on as a wandering rogue
from parish to parish, by the officers therein, in 26 days
to his native place, Cheshunt in Hertfordshire, and as the
Churchwardens were conveying him on horseback over
Black Down, he died on the back of the horse, and was
buried the same night."</p></div>

<p>The parson of Whitchurch was a Mr. Polwhele,
who was also justice of peace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>Here is another curious entry in the same book
of registers:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"1756, Sept. 12, Robert Elford, was baptized, the child
of Susanna Elford by her sister's husband, to whom she
was married with the consent of her sister, the wife, who
was at the wedding."</p></div>

<p>Here the union is not with a <em>deceased</em> wife's sister,
but the living wife's sister. There is no entry relative
to this marriage, so that the pair must have got their
unhallowed union blessed in some remote parish,
where the relationship was not known.</p>

<p>In 1760 William Creedy, sojourner, and Susanna
Elford had their banns called, but there is no entry
of a marriage.</p>

<p>Another entry in the same register book is suggestive
of a scandal.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"1627, Aug. 5, Baptized, Nicolas filius Mri. Johan.
Cake jam senio confecti."</p></div>

<p>Mary Tavy church, picturesquely situated, not on
the Tavy, but on a little confluent, was barbarously
renovated some years ago, but of late much loving
care has been bestowed upon the structure, and something
has been done to efface the mischief wrought
by the architect who had dealt with it previously.
The new screen is remarkably good, and in accordance
with Devonshire work of the sixteenth century.
The stained glass is excellent.</p>

<p>Peter Tavy church was disfigured rather later
than Mary Tavy. It possessed an interesting Tudor
square pew, richly carved, and with posts at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
corners supporting heraldic beasts. This was demolished
at the so-called restoration. Some scraps
have been preserved and worked up to form a screen
across the tower arch. All the modern work is of
the vulgarest description, in yellow deal. A portion
of the screen with saints painted on it is preserved
within the altar rails.</p>

<p>Peter Tavy Combe must on no account be
neglected; it is a remarkably picturesque valley.</p>

<p>Another church that may be visited from Lydford
is Bridestowe, dedicated to S. Bridget, who had a
sanctuary of refuge here, now called the Sentry.
The original church stood in a different position,
and contained the Norman arch now erected at the
entrance to the church avenue. It was turned into
a church-house, then became ruinous and was pulled
down. The reason for the removal of the parish
church in the fifteenth century was probably because
the old church was near the road at a turn, so that
there was not space available to enlarge it.</p>

<p>This church has suffered from maltreatment by
a late rector, who tore down the old roodscreen,
sawed it down the middle, and plastered the tracery
so treated against a deal dwarf screen, <em>inverted</em>,
and against a vestry door. To make matters worse,
he boarded the entire interior of the chancel with
deal, varnished. It presented the appearance of a
cabin of a ship. This has now happily disappeared.
It is greatly to be desired that the screen should
be restored.</p>

<p>Second to the Dart only in beauty is the West
Okement that comes foaming down from the bogs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
about Cranmere through a fine ravine between Yes
Tor and Amicombe Hill. If the river be followed
up from Meldon Viaduct, a point is reached where it
rushes over a barrier of rocks fallen from Black Tor,
and divides about an islet. But perhaps the best way
to see this valley is to ascend a combe, crossed at the
foot by the Lake Viaduct, and follow a track that
sweeps round Sourton Tor, and ascend to Bronescombe's
Loaf and Cheese, where is a fine cairn.
On the slope between Sourton Tor and Bronescombe's
Loaf lies a large slab of granite through
which a dyke of elvan has been thrust. In this
elvan have been cut the moulds for two bronze
axe-heads.</p>

<p>Walter Bronescombe was Bishop of Exeter between
1258 and 1280, and he lies buried in the Cathedral
under a fine canopied tomb. The effigy is of his own
date, and gives apparently a true portrait of a worthy
prelate.</p>

<p>One day he was visiting this portion of his diocese,
and had ventured to ride over the moor from Widdecombe.
He and his retinue had laboured through
bogs, and almost despaired of reaching the confines
of the wilderness. Moreover, on attaining Amicombe
Hill they knew not which way to take, for the
bogs there are nasty; and his attendants dispersed
to seek a way. The Bishop was overcome with
fatigue, and was starving. He turned to his chaplain
and said, "Our Master in the wilderness was offered
by Satan bread made of stones. If he were now to
make the same offer to me, I doubt if I should have
the Christian fortitude to refuse."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah!" sighed the chaplain, "and a hunch of cheese
as well!"</p>

<p>"Bread and cheese I could not hold out against,"
said the Bishop.</p>

<p>Hardly had he spoken before a moorman rose up
from a peat dyke and drew nigh; he had a wallet
on his back.</p>

<p>"Master!" called the chaplain, "dost thou chance
to have a snack of meat with thee?"</p>

<p>"Ay, verily," replied the moorman, and approached,
hobbling, for he was apparently lame. "I have with
me bread and cheese, naught else."</p>

<p>"Give it us, my son," said the Bishop; "I will well
repay thee."</p>

<p>"Nay," replied the stranger, "I be no son of thine.
And I ask no reward save that thou descend from
thy steed, doff thy cap, and salute me with the title
of master."</p>

<p>"I will do that," said the Bishop, and alighted.</p>

<p>Then the strange man produced a loaf and a large
piece of cheese.</p>

<p>Now, the Bishop was about to take off his cap and
address the moorman in a tone of entreaty and by
the title of master, when the chaplain perceived that
the man had one foot like that of a goat. He
instantly cried out to God, and signified what he
saw to the prelate, who, in holy horror, made the
sign of the cross, and lo! the moorman vanished,
and the bread and cheese remained transformed
to stone.</p>

<p>Do you doubt it? Go and see. Look on the
Ordnance Survey map and you will find Bread
and Cheese marked there. Only Bronescombe's
name has been transformed to Brandescombe.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>But the Bishop, to make atonement, and to
ease his conscience for having so nearly yielded
to temptation, spent great sums on the rebuilding
of his cathedral.</p>

<p>From the Bread and Cheese, a walk along the
brow of the hill by the Slipper Stones&mdash;so called
because there Bishop Bronescombe dropped one
of the coverings of his feet&mdash;shows the valley to
perfection, with Black Tor rising above it, and Yes
Tor towering high aloft in the rear. By the stream
below is a stunted copse, a relic of the ancient arms
of forest that stole up the ravines far into the moor,
but of which now hardly any remain. At Stinga
Tor, further up, is a fine logan rock. The visitor
may return by the peat-works and the noble pile of
Lynx Tor to the valley of the Lyd.</p>

<p>An interesting excursion may be made to Tavy
Cleave. The course to be adopted, so as to see it in
perfection, is to go on to the moor from the Dartmoor
Inn. Here in its proper season, August to October,
the field gentian, with its dull purple flowers, may be
gathered. A descent to the Lyd by some old mine
works opens a fine view of Lynx, Hare, and Doe
Tors, and the little farm named after the latter lies
before one, solitary in the midst of heather and
swamp. Stepping-stones allow the river to be
crossed, and the farm is reached and passed, and
Hare Tor is aimed at. Old stream-works and prospecting
pits abound. By leaving the summit of
Hare Tor on the left, a cluster of rocks rising above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
the grass and heather must be struck at, and suddenly
before the eye opens the ravine of the Tavy, that
foams far below over a bar of red granite.</p>

<p>Between the rocks and Ger Tor is a cluster of hut
circles in tolerable preservation, and a very interesting
collection is found on a spur of Stannon, on the further
side of the Tavy.</p>

<p>Lynx Tor may be ascended from Lydford. The
summit is occupied by a fine mass of rocks, and
commands a superb view as far as the Atlantic in
one direction, and Plymouth Sound and the Channel
in another.</p>

<p>Near Lynx Tor are the peat-works already
mentioned. Various attempts have been made to
find for the peat a use that may prove commercially
successful, but hitherto these attempts have not been
satisfactory to investors. The bogs are hungry, and
swallow up a good deal of money.</p>

<p>Hence a short diversion will take to the logan
rock on Stinga Tor.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/p142.jpg" width="700" height="334" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>INSCRIPTION ON SOURTON CROSS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>On Sourton Down stands an old granite cross that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
bears an inscription only to be read when the sun
is setting and casts its rays aslant over the face.
Apparently the monolith was shaped into a Latin
cross at some period later than the inscription, which
belongs to the sixth century. It is headed by the
early Christian symbol of the ☧ but badly made.
The same symbol occurs on the inscribed stone at
Southill. The granite is of a very coarse texture,
especially where the figure occurs and at the beginning
of the name.</p>

<p>As for every person, so for every place, a time
comes if waited for. It has come for Lydford, burnt
by Danes, deserted in the Middle Ages, abandoned
by its rectors.</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"At six o'clock I came along<br /></span>

<p>So wrote Browne in the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>But the time has arrived for Lydford at last, and
now in summer it is hardly possible for a visitor to
obtain lodgings, unless he has written to secure them
months before, so greatly does Lydford attract to it
those who have eyes to see beautiful scenery and
hearts to appreciate it.</p>

<p>"Much interest, not only local but world-wide, was
aroused a few months back by the announcement of a
Phœnician survival at Ipplepen, in the person of Mr.
Thomas Ballhatchet, descendant of the priest of the Sun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
Temple there, and until lately owner of the plot of land

the Rechabites, etc. Ballhatchet's sole peculiarity is
his holding on to the land, in which, however, he is kept
in countenance in England by the Purkises, who drew the
body of Rufus to its grave in Winchester Cathedral on
2nd August, 1100.</p>

<p>"Further quiet research makes it clear beyond all manner
of doubt that the Phœnician tin colony, domiciled at
Totnes, and whose Sun Temple was located on their eastern
sky-line at Ipplepen, have left extensive traces of their
presence all the way down the Dart in the identical and
unaltered names of places, a test of which the Palestine
Exploration Committee record the priceless value. To give
but one instance. The beautiful light-refracting diadem
which makes Belliver<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> the most striking of all her sister
tors, received from the Semite its consecration as 'Baallivyah,'
Baal, crown of beauty or glory. The word itself
occurs in Proverbs i. 9 and iv. 9, and as both Septuagint
and Vulgate so render it, it must have borne that meaning
in the third century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, and in the third century <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>, and,
of course, in the interval. There are many other instances
quite as close, and any student of the new and fascinating
science of Assyriology will continually add to them. A
portrait of Ballhatchet, with some notes by an eminent and
well-known Semitic scholar, may probably appear in the
<cite>Graphic</cite>; in the meantime it may be pointed out that his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>name is typically Babylonian. Not only is there at Pantellaria
the gravestone of one Baal-yachi (Baal's beloved), but
no less than three clay tablets from the Sun Temple of
Sippara (the Bible Sepharvaim) bear the names of Baal-achi-iddin,
Baal-achi-utsur, and Baal-achi-irriba. This last,
which bears date 22 Sivan (in the eleventh year of Nabonidus,
<span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 540), just two years before the catastrophe which
followed on Belshazzar's feast, is in the possession of Mr.
W. G. Thorpe, <span class="smcap">F.S.A.</span> It is in beautiful condition, and
records a loan by one Dinkiva to Baal-achi-irriba (Baal will
protect his brother), on the security of some slaves."</p></div>

<p>One really wonders in reading such nonsense as
this whether modern education is worth much, when
a man could write such trash and an editor could
admit it into his paper.</p>

<p>Ballhatchet means the hatchet or gate to a ball,
<em>i.e.</em> a mine.</p>

<p>As it happens, there is not a particle of trustworthy
evidence that the Phœnicians ever traded directly
with Cornwall and Devon. The intermediary traders
were the Veneti of what is now Vannes, and the tin
trade was carried through Gaul to Marseilles, as is
shown by traces left on the old trade route. In the
next place, there is no evidence that our British
or Ivernian ancestors ever heard the name of Baal.
And finally, Belstone is not named after a stone at
all, to return to the point whence we started. In
Domesday it is Bellestham, or the <em>ham</em>, meadow of
Belles or Bioll, a Saxon name that remains among
us as Beale.</p>

<p>Belstone is situated at the lip of Taw Marsh, once
a fine lake, with Steeperton Tor rising above it at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
the head. Partly because the river has fretted a
way through the joints of the granite, forming Belstone
Cleave, and partly on account of the silting up
of the lake-bed with rubble brought down by the
several streams that here unite, the lake-bed is now
filled up with sand and gravel and swamp.</p>

<p>The military authorities coveted this tract for
artillery practice. They set up butts, but woman
intervened. A very determined lady marched up to
them, although the warning red flags fluttered, and
planted herself in front of a target, took out of her
reticule a packet of ham sandwiches and a flask of
cold tea, and declared her intention of spending the
day there. In vain did the military protest, entreat,
remonstrate; she proceeded to nibble at her sandwiches
and defied them to fire.</p>

<p>She carried the day.</p>

<p>Since then Taw Marsh has been the playfield of
many children, and has been rambled over by
visitors, but the artillery have abstained from practising
on it.</p>

<p>The fact is that the military have made the moors
about Okehampton impossible for the visitor, and
those who desire to rove over it in pursuit of health
have been driven from Okehampton to Belstone, and
object to be moved on further.</p>

<p>What with the camp at Okehampton and the
prisons at Princetown and encroachments on every
side, the amount of moorland left open to the rambler
is greatly curtailed.</p>

<p>The privation is not only felt by the visitor but
also by the farmer, who has a right to send out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
his sheep and cattle upon the moor in summer, and
in times of drought looks to this upland as his
salvation.</p>

<p>A comparison between what the Forest of Dartmoor
was at the beginning of this century and its
condition to-day shows how inclosures have crept
on&mdash;nay, not crept, increased by leaps; and what
is true of the forest is true also of the commons
that surround it. Add to the inclosed land the large
tract swept by the guns at Okehampton, and the
case becomes more grave still. The public have
been robbed of their rights wholesale. Not a word
can now be raised against the military. The Transvaal
War has brought home to us the need we have
to become expert marksmen, and the Forest of
Dartmoor seems to offer itself for the purpose of
a practising-ground. Nevertheless, one accepts the
situation with a sigh.</p>

<p>There is a charming excursion up the East Okement
from the railway bridge to Cullever Steps,
passing on the way a little fall of the river, not
remarkable for height but for picturesqueness. There
is no path, and the excursion demands exertion.</p>

<p>On Belstone Common is a stone circle and near it
a fallen menhir. The circle is merely one of stones
that formed a hut, which had upright slabs lining
it within as well as girdling without.</p>

<p>Under Belstone Tor, among the "old men's workings"
by the Taw, an experienced eye will detect
a blowing-house, but it is much dilapidated.</p>

<p>The Taw and an affluent pour down from the
central bog, one on each side of Steeperton Tor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
and from the east the small brook dances into Taw
Marsh. Beside the latter, on the slopes, are numerous
pounds and hut circles, and near its source is
a stone circle, of which the best uprights have
been carried off for gateposts. South of it is a
menhir, the Whitmoor Stone, leaning, as the
ground about it is marshy. Cosdon, or, as it is
incorrectly called occasionally, Cawsand, is a huge
rounded hill ascending to 1,785 feet, crowned with
dilapidated cairns and ruined kistvaens. East of the
summit, near the turf track from South Zeal, is a
cairn that contained three kistvaens. One is perfect,
one wrecked, and of the third only the space remained
and indications whence the slabs had been
torn. From these three kistvaens in one mound
start three stone rows that are broken through by
the track, but can be traced beyond it for some
way; they have been robbed, as the householders of
South Zeal have been of late freely inclosing large
tracts of their common, and have taken the stones
for the construction of walls about their fields.</p>

<p>By ascending the Taw, Cranmere Pool may be
reached, but is only so far worth the visit that the
walk to and from it gives a good insight into the
nature of the central bogs. The pool is hardly more
than a puddle. Belstone church is not interesting;
it was rebuilt, all but the tower, in 1881.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>INSCRIBED STONE, STICKLEPATH.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Under Cosdon nestles Sticklepath. "Stickle" is the
Devonshire for steep. Here is a holy well near an
inscribed stone. A second inscribed stone is by the
roadside to Okehampton. At Belstone are two more,
but none of these bear names. They are Christian
monuments of the sixth, or at latest seventh,
century. At Sticklepath was a curious old cob
thatched chapel, but this has been unnecessarily
destroyed, and a modern erection of no interest or
beauty has taken its place. South Zeal is an interesting
little village, through which ran the old
high-road, but which is now left on one side. For
long it was a treasury of interesting old houses;
many have disappeared recently, but the "Oxenham
Arms," the seat of the Burgoyne family, remains,
the fine old village cross, and the chapel, of granite.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
Above South Zeal, on West Wyke Moor, is the
house that belonged to the Battishill family, with
a ruined cross near it. The house has been much
spoiled of late; the stone mullions have been removed
from the hall window, but the ancient gateway,
surmounted by the Battishill arms, and with
the date 1656, remains untouched. It is curious,
because one would hardly have expected a country
gentleman to have erected an embattled gateway
during the Commonwealth, and in the style of the
early Tudor kings. In the hall window are the
arms of Battishill, impaled with a coat that cannot
be determined as belonging to any known
family. In the same parish of South Tawton is
another old house, North Wyke, that belonged to
the Wyke or Weekes family. The ancient gatehouse
and chapel are interesting; they belong, in
my opinion, to the sixteenth century, and to the
latter part of the same. The chapel has a corbel,
the arms of Wykes and Gifford; and John Wyke
of North Wyke, who was buried in 1591, married
the daughter of Sir Roger Gifford. The gateway
can hardly be earlier. The house was built by the
same man, but underwent great alteration in the
fashion introduced from France by Charles II., when
the rooms were raised and the windows altered into
<em>croisées</em>.</p>

<p>Touching this house a tale is told.</p>

<p>About the year 1660 there was a John Weekes
of North Wyke, who was a bachelor, and lived in
the old mansion along with his sister Katherine,
who was unmarried, and his mother. He was a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
of weak intellect, and was consumptive. John came
of age in 1658. In the event of his death without
will his heir would be his uncle John, his father's
brother, who died in 1680. This latter John had
a son Roger.</p>

<p>Now it happened that there was a great scamp
of the name of Richard Weekes, born at Hatherleigh,
son of Francis Weekes of Honeychurch, possibly a
remote connection, but not demonstrably so.</p>

<p>He was a gentleman pensioner of Charles II., but
spent most of his leisure time in the Fleet Prison.
One day this rascal came down from London, it
is probable at the suggestion of consumptive John's
mother and sister, who could not be sure what he,
with his feeble mind, might do with the estate.</p>

<p>Richard ingratiated himself into the favour of
John, and urged him not to risk his health in so
bleak and exposed a spot as South Tawton, but
to seek a warmer climate, and he invited him to
Plymouth. The unsuspicious John assented.</p>

<p>When John was cajoled to Plymouth, Richard
surrounded him with creatures of his own, a doctor
and two lawyers, who, with Richard's assistance,
coaxed, bullied, and persuaded the sickly John into
making a deed of settlement of all his estate in
favour of Richard. The unhappy man did this, but
with a curious proviso enabling him to revoke his
act by word as well as by deed. Richard had now
completely outwitted John's mother and sister, who
had been conspirators with him, on the understanding
that they were to share the spoils.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 563px;">
<img src="images/p152.jpg" width="563" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>NORTH WYKE GATE HOUSE</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>After a while, when it was clear that John was
dying, Richard hurried him back to North Wyke,
where he expired on Saturday, September 21st,
1661, but not till he had been induced by his mother
and sister to revoke his will verbally, for they had
now learned how that the wily Richard had got the
better of them.</p>

<p>Next day, Sunday, Richard Weekes arrived,
booted and spurred, at the head of a party of men
he had collected. With sword drawn he burst into
the house, and when Katherine Weekes attempted to
bar the way he knocked her down. Then he drove
the widow mother into a closet and locked the door
on her. He now cleared the house of the servants,
and proceeded to take possession of all the documents
and valuables that the mansion contained. Poor
John's body lay upstairs: no regard was paid to
that, and, saying "I am come to do the devil's work
and my own," he drove Katherine out of the house,
and she was constrained to take refuge for the night
in a neighbouring farm. The widow, Mary Weekes,
was then liberated and also turned out of doors.</p>

<p>The heir-at-law was the uncle John, against whom
Mary and Katherine Weekes had conspired with the
scoundrel Richard. This latter now sought Uncle
John, made him drunk, and got him to sign a deed,
when tipsy, conveying all his rights to the said
Richard for the sum of fifty pounds paid down.
Richard was now in possession. The widow thereupon
brought an action in Chancery against Richard.
The lawyers saw the opportunity. Here was a noble
estate that might be sucked dry, and they descended
on it with this end in view.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>The lawsuit was protracted for forty years, from
1661 to 1701, when the heirs of the wicked Richard
retained the property, but it had been so exhausted
and burdened, that the suit was abandoned undecided.
Richard Weekes died in 1670.</p>

<p>The plan resorted to in order to keep possession
after the forcible entry was this. The son of Richard
Weekes had married a Northmore of Well, in South
Tawton, and the Northmores bought up all the
debts on the estate and got possession of the mortgages,
and worked them persistently and successfully
against the rightful claimants till, worried and
wearied out, and with empty purses, they were
unable further to pursue the claim. In 1713 the
estate was sold by John Weekes, the grandson of
Richard, who had also married a Northmore, and
North Wyke passed away from the family after
having been in its possession since the reign of
Henry III.</p>

<p>It was broken up into two farms, and the house
divided into two. Recently it has, however, been
repurchased by a descendant of the original possessors,
in a female line, the Rev. W. Wykes Finch, and the
house is being restored in excellent taste.</p>

<p>In South Tawton church is a fine monument of
the common ancestor, John Wyke, 1591. The church
has been renovated, monumental slabs sawn in half
and used to line the drain round the church externally.
With the exception of the sun-dial, bearing
the motto from Juvenal, "<i lang="la">Obrepet non intellecta
senectus</i>," and a Burgoyne monument and that of
"Warrior Wyke," the church does not present much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
of interest at present, whatever it may have done
before it fell into the hands of spoilers.</p>

<p>The West Okement comes down from the central
bogs through a fine "Valley of Rocks," dividing and
forming an islet overgrown with wild rose and whortleberry.
Above it stands Shilstone Tor, telling by its
name that on it at one time stood a cromlech, which
has been destroyed. This valley furnishes many
studies for the artist.</p>

<p>Hence Yes Tor may be ascended, for long held
to be the highest elevation on Dartmoor. The
highest peak it is, rising to 2,030 feet, but it is over-topped
by the rounded High Willhayes, 2,039 feet.
Between Yes Tor and Mill Tor is a rather nasty bog.
Mill Tor consists of a peculiar granite; the feldspar
is so pure that speculators have been induced to
attempt to make soda-water bottles out of it, by
fusing without the adjunct of other materials.</p>

<p>On the extreme edge of a ridge above the East
Okement, opposite Belstone Tor, is a camp, much
injured by the plough. Apparently from it leads
a paved raised causeway or road, presumed to be
Roman; but why such a road should have been made
from a precipitous headland above the Okement, and
whither it led, are shrouded in mystery. Near this
road, in 1897, was found a hoard of the smallest
Roman coins, probably the store of some beggar,
which he concealed under a rock, and died without
being able to recover it. All pertained to the years
between <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 320 and 330.</p>

<p>Of Okehampton I will say nothing here, as the
place has had a chapter devoted to it in my <em>Book of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
the West</em>&mdash;too much space, some might say, for in
itself it is devoid of interest. Its charm is in the
scenery round, and its great attraction during the
summer is the artillery camp on the down above
Okehampton Park. On the other side of Belstone,
Throwleigh may be visited, where there are numerous
prehistoric relics. There were many others, but they
have been destroyed, amongst others a fine inclosure
like Grimspound, but more perfect, as the inclosing
wall was not ruinous throughout, and the stones were
laid in courses. The pulpit of Throwleigh church is
made up of old bench-ends.</p>

<p class="drop-capw"><span class="smcap">Chagford</span> is in Domesday written Chageford,
and this is the local pronunciation of the name
at the present day. The natives say "Chageford in
the dirt&mdash;O good Lord!"</p>

<p>But Chagford has had the ability and promptitude
to get out of the dirt and prove itself to be anything
but a stick-in-the-mud place. It is with places as
with people, some have good luck fall to them, others
make their fortunes for themselves. Okehampton
belongs to the former class, Chagford to the latter.
It owes almost everything to a late rector, who, resolved
on pushing the place, invited down magazine
editors and professional <em>littérateurs</em>, entertained them,
drove them about, and was rewarded by articles
appearing in journals and serials, be-lauding Chagford
for its salubrious climate, its incomparable scenery,
its ready hospitality, its rural sweetness, and its
archæological interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>Whither the writers pointed with their pens, thither
the public ran, and Chagford was made. It has now
every appliance suitable&mdash;pure water, electric lighting,
telephone, a bicycle shop, and doctors to patch
broken heads and set broken limbs of those upset
from the "bikes."</p>

<p>Chagford is undoubtedly a picturesque and pleasant
spot. It is situated near Dartmoor, and is sheltered
from the cold and from the rainy drift that comes
from the south-west. The lodging-house keepers
know how to make visitors comfortable, and to
charge for so doing. The church has been restored,
coaches run to bring visitors, and the roads and lanes
have been widened.</p>

<p>I recall the church before modern ideas had penetrated
to Chagford. At that time the clerk, who
also led the orchestra, gave out the psalm from his
seat under the reading-desk, then, <em>whistling</em> the tune,
he marched slowly down the nave, ascended to the
gallery with leisure, and the performance began.</p>

<p>The church, dedicated to S. Michael, was rebuilt
in the middle of the fifteenth century, when the
Gorges family owned much land in the parish.
Their cognisance, the <em>whirlpool</em>, a canting cognisance
(<em>gurges</em>), appears in the bosses of the roof. It contains
two monuments of some importance: one is
a handsome stone altar tomb, with a canopy supported
on columns, in memory of Sir John Whiddon,
of Whiddon Park, Judge of Queen's Bench, who
died in 1575; the other is to commemorate John
Prouze, who died in 1664.</p>

<p>The Three Crowns Inn, opposite the church, is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
picturesque building of the seventeenth century.
Chagford was one of the Stannary towns, but no
remains of the court-house exist.</p>

<p>On Mattadon, above the town, stands a rude early
cross of granite.</p>

<p>The ascent to the moor by Tincombe Lane, as
I remember it half a century ago, was no better than
a watercourse, strewn with boulders, to be scrambled
up or down at the risk of dislocation of the ankle.
It then well merited the descriptive lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Tincombe Lane is all uphill<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or downhill, as you take it;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You tumble up, and crack your crown,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or tumble down and break it.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Tincombe Lane is crook'd and straight,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Here pothook, there as arrow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis smooth to foot, 'tis full of rut,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'Tis wide, and then, 'tis narrow.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Tincombe Lane is just like life,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From when you leave your mother;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis sometimes this, 'tis sometimes that,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'Tis one thing or the other."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Now all is changed. A steam-roller goes up and
down Tincombe Lane, the angles have been rounded,
the precipitous portions made easy, the ruts filled up.
And life likewise is now made easy for the rising
generation&mdash;possibly too easy. Ruggedness had a
charm of its own, and bred vigour of constitution
and moral physique.</p>

<p>Chagford having lost, by death, the whistling clerk,
started a blind organist. Now, also, he is gone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
Every peculiarity is being crushed out of modern life
by the steam-roller, civilisation.</p>

<p>Chagford Common, as I recall it, half a century
ago, was strewn thick with hut circles. One ascended
to it by Tincombe Lane and came into a prehistoric
world, a Pompeii of a past before Rome was. It was
dense with hut circles, pounds, and every sort of relic
of the ancient inhabitants of the moor. But inclosures
have been made, and but a very few relics
of the aboriginal settlement remain. One of the
most curious, the "Roundy Pound," only escaped
through urgent remonstrance made to spare it. The
road carried over the common annually eats up the
remains of old, as the road-menders take away the
stones from the hut circles to metal the highway.</p>

<p>At Batworthy, one of the inclosures, there must
have been anciently a manufactory of flint tools and
weapons. Countless spalls of flint and a fine collection
of fabricated weapons and tools have been found
there, and the collection has been presented from this
place to the Plymouth Municipal Museum.</p>

<p>On Gidleigh Common, beside the Teign, opposite
Batworthy, is Scaur Hill circle. It consists of thirty-two
stones, at present, of which eight are prostrate.
The highest of the stones is a little over six feet.
The circle is ninety-two feet in diameter. Apparently
leading towards this ring, on the Chagford side of
the river, was a very long double row of stones, with
a second double row or avenue branching from it.</p>

<p>There was a third double row, which started from
the Longstone, near Caistor Rock. This Longstone
is still standing, but the stone rows have been shamefully
robbed by a farmer to build his newtake walls.
I give plan of the rows as taken by me in 1851.
There was another line of stones leading from the
Three Boys to the Longstone. The Three Boys
were three big stones that have disappeared, and the
line from them has also been obliterated. This
portion I unfortunately did not plan in 1851.</p>

<p>In the valley of the Teign is the so-called tolmen,
a natural formation. In the same slab or stone may
be seen the beginnings of a second hole. But it is
curious as showing that the river at one time rolled
at a higher elevation than at present. The scenes
on a ramble up the river from Chagford to Holy
Street Mill and the mill itself are familiar to many,
as having furnished subjects for pictures in the Royal
Academy.</p>

<p>The river Teign below Whiddon Park winds in
and out among wooded precipitous hills to where
the Exeter road descends in zigzags to Fingle
Bridge, passing on its way Cranbrook Castle, a
stone camp. The <em>brook</em> in the name is a corruption
of <em>burgh</em> or <em>burrh</em>. On the opposite side of the valley,
frowning across at Cranbrook, is Prestonbury Camp.</p>

<p>With advantage the river may be followed down
for several miles to Dunsford Bridge, and the opportunity
is then obtained of gathering white heath which
grows on the slopes. At Shilstone in Drewsteignton
is the only cromlech in the county. It is a fine
monument. A few years ago it fell, but has been
re-erected in its old position. After recent ploughing
flints may be picked up in the field where it stands.</p>

<p>Gidleigh merits a visit, the road to it presenting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
many delicious peeps. Gidleigh possesses the ruin
of a doll castle that once belonged to the Prouze
family. The church contains a screen in good preservation.
In the parish of Throwleigh is the
interesting manor house Wanson, of which I have
told a story in my <cite>Old English Home</cite>.</p>

<p>But perhaps more interesting than manor houses
are the old farm buildings in the neighbourhood of
Chagford, rapidly disappearing or being altered out
of recognition to adapt them to serve as lodging-houses
to receive visitors.</p>

<p>One such adaptation may be noticed in Tincombe
Lane. An old house is passed, where the ancient
mullioned windows have been heightened and the
floors and ceilings raised, to the lasting injury of
the house itself, considered from a picturesque point
of view. A passable road leads up the South Teign
to Fernworthy, a substantial farm in a singularly
lone spot. But there was another farm even more
lonely at Assacombe, where a lateral stream descends
to the Teign, but it has been abandoned, and consists
now of ruin only. Near it is a well-preserved
double stone row leading from a cairn and finishing
at a blocking-stone.</p>

<p>At Fernworthy itself is a circle of upright stones
and the remains of several stone rows sorely mutilated
for the construction of a newtake wall. In a tumulus
near these monuments was found an urn containing
ashes, with a flint knife, and another, very small, of
bronze or copper, and a large polished button of
horn. On Chagford Common, near Watern Hill, is
a double pair of rows leading from a cairn and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
small menhir, to blocking-stones. Although the
stones of which they are composed are small, the
rows are remarkably well preserved.</p>

<p>It will repay the visitor to continue his ascent of
the South Teign to the Grey Wethers, two circles
of stone, of which, however, many are fallen. Here
exploration, such as has been conducted at Fernworthy
circle, shows that the floors are deep in
ashes, and this leads to the surmise that the circles
were the crematories of the dead who lie in the
cairns and tunnels in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Near the source of the North Teign is Teignhead
House, one of the most solitary spots in England.
A shepherd resides there, but it is not for many
winters that a woman can endure the isolation and
retain her reason.</p>

<p>And yet there remain the ruins of a house in
a still more lonely situation. The moorman points
it out as Browne's House.</p>

<p>Although, judging from the dilapidation and the
lichened condition of the stones, one could have supposed
that this edifice was of great antiquity, yet it
is not so by any means. There are those still alive
who remember when the chimney fell; and who had
heard of both the building, the occupying, and the
destruction of Browne's House. Few indeed have
seen the ruin, for it is in so remote a spot that only
the shepherd, the rush-cutter, and the occasional
fisherman approach it.</p>

<p>On the Ordnance Survey, faint indications of inclosures
are given on the spot, but no name is
attached. Yet every moorman, if asked what these
ruins are, will tell you that it is the wreck of
Browne's House.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>GRIMSPOUND, AND ENTRANCE</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>The story told me relative to this solitary spot was
that Browne, an ungainly, morose man, had a pretty
young wife, of whom he was jealous. He built this
place in which to live with her away from the society
of men, and the danger such proximity might bring
to his connubial happiness.</p>

<p>Grimspound will be visited from Chagford. The
way to it after leaving the high-road from Post Bridge
to Moreton, which it crosses, traverses Shapleigh
Common, where are numerous inclosures in connection
with hut circles. One of these is very large,
and constructed of huge slabs of granite. Several of
these larger circles were occupied only in summer,
it would appear, as there are scanty traces of fire in
them, whereas attached to them are small huts, the
floors of which are thickly strewn with charcoal and
fragments of pottery, and presumably the cooking
was done in these latter.</p>

<p>Grimspound is an irregular circular inclosure containing
four acres within the boundary wall. It is
situated on the slope of a hill, and the position is
obviously ill-adapted for defence, as it is commanded
by higher ground on three sides. A little stream,
the Grimslake, flows through the inclosure.</p>

<p>The wall itself is double-faced, and the two faces
have fallen inwards. This shows that the core could
not have been of turf, as in that case shrubs would
have rooted themselves therein and have thrust the
walls outward. In several places openings appear
from the inside of the pound into the space between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
the walls. It is possible that this intermediate
hollow was used for stores, and that the walls were
tied together with timber, and surmounted with
a parapet of turf. A trackway from Manaton to
Headland Warren runs through the pound, and the
wall has been broken through for this purpose in two
places; but the original entrance to the S.S.E. is
perfect, and is paved, and in it three steps have been
formed, as the descent was into the pound, another
token that the inclosure was not intended as a
fortress.</p>

<p>The entrance is 8 feet wide, and no outwork was
constructed to protect it from being "rushed" by an
enemy. The walls of the inclosure here and
throughout are from 10 feet to 12 feet thick, and
stone does not exist in any part which could raise
them above 5 feet 6 inches in height. Each wall
is 3 feet 6 inches wide at base, and was 3 feet at top.
On the west side is a huge slab set on edge, measuring
10 feet by 5 feet, and it is from 9 inches to 1 foot
in thickness, and weighs from 3 to 4 tons. Other
stones, laid in courses, if not so long, are not of less
weight. Such a wall as that inclosing Grimspound
would cost, with modern appliances and with horse
power for drawing the stone, three guineas per land
yard, and a land yard would engage four men for a
week.</p>

<p>When, moreover, we consider that the circumference
of the wall measures over 1,500 feet, it becomes
obvious that a large body of men must have been
engaged in the erection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>Presumably Grimspound was not a fortified village,
and was merely a pound into which cattle were
driven for protection against wolves. It is just
possible, but hardly probable, that it was the place
of refuge for the scattered population on Hookner
and Hamildon.</p>

<p>Within the pound are twenty-four hut circles;
most have been explored, and one (No. III. on the
plan) has been partially restored, and is inclosed
within a railing. The object of this restoration was
to discover, by piling up the stones found in and
about the wall of the hut, what its height had been
originally, and this was determined to have been
four feet.</p>

<p>Unless wantonly injured by trippers, it will serve
to exhibit what the structure of these habitations
was, with its paved platform as bed, and its hearth
and vestibule.</p>

<p>A double hut (XVIII., XIX.) is interesting because
a tall stone was erected beside it, as though to indicate
it as being the residence of some man of
importance, maybe the sheik of the community.
In hut XVI. is a double bed, one couch divided from
the other by upright stones.</p>

<p>In several of the huts, in the floor, are laid flat
stones with a smooth surface, and it was supposed
that these served as chopping-stones, but further
explorations have led to the belief that they were
employed to sustain a central pole that upheld
the roof.</p>

<p>On the <em>col</em> above Grimspound, near the source of
Grimslake, is a cairn that contains a small kistvaen,
and is surrounded by a circle of stones set upright.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>Numerous cairns crown the heights. One immense
tumulus, King's Barrow, has at some unknown time
been excavated with great labour.</p>

<p>The great central trackway crosses Hamildon, and
is very perfect where it does so. It had apparently
no connection whatever with Grimspound.</p>

<p>From Grimspound may be seen, on the brow of
the ridge connecting Birch Tor and Challacombe
Down, a series of stone rows. They lead to a
blocking-stone, or menhir, at the south extremity.
The northern end has been destroyed by tin-streamers,
whose works in Chaw Gully are interesting,
for mining has been combined with streaming.
The rock has been cut through, but no signs of the
use of iron wedges for splitting the granite can here
be discovered. It is traditionally told that what was
done was to cut a groove in the granite, fill that with
quicklime, and pour water on it. The lime in swelling
split the rock. Ravens nest here; and I have
seen rock doves and the pair of ravens nesting
almost side by side.</p>

<p>Below is the Webburn, the stream turned up by
tinners. There one mine continues in activity&mdash;the
"Golden Dagger." Above is Vitifer, where fortunes
have been made&mdash;and lost; mostly the latter by
investors, mainly the former by the "captains" and
promoters.</p>

<p class="drop-capw"><span class="smcap">The</span> position of Manaton is one of remarkable
beauty, between Lustleigh Cleave and the ridge
on which stands Bowerman's Nose, and which swells
up to Hound Tor.</p>

<p>The church is dedicated to S. Winefred, the Welsh
martyr maid, and has its fine screen carefully restored.
It formerly possessed a singular feature, which the
"restoring" architect destroyed, because singular.
This was a small window in the east wall opening
from the outside, <em>under</em> the altar. Perhaps there
were relics of S. Winefred kept beneath the altar,
and through this <i lang="la">fenestrella confessionis</i> the devotees
could touch them. But, indeed, the destroyer has
been at Manaton and effaced more than this window.
On the tor that commands the village were formerly
many prehistoric monuments. The farm Langstone
by its name proclaims that on it was a menhir. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
the churchyard was a fine granite cross. A former
rector, the Rev. C. Carwithen, wantonly destroyed it
in the night. The people had been wont at a funeral
to carry the corpse the way of the sun thrice round
the cross before interment. He preached against the
custom ineffectually, so he secretly smashed the cross.
There are two logan rocks within easy reach&mdash;the
Whooping Stone on Easdon, and the Nutcracker in
Lustleigh Cleave.</p>

<p>This cleave is very picturesque. "Cleave" properly
is a local softening of the word "cliff," and applies to
the rocks, but in common use it has come incorrectly
to be applied to the valley below the crags. Through
the stone-strewn trough of the vale the sparkling
Bovey finds its way with some difficulty, diving
under the boulders at Horsham Steps, and running
unseen for some considerable distance, only proclaiming
its presence by its murmurs and whispers.</p>

<p>That there was some fighting done across this
valley is probable, because there are camps on both
sides.</p>

<p>In honourable contrast with Mr. Carwithen stands
Mr. Jones, the curate of North Bovey, who fished the
old village cross out of the brook, where it had lain
since the iconoclastic period of the Civil Wars, and
re-erected it in 1829.</p>

<p>North Bovey church, pleasantly situated, possesses
a screen much mutilated, but capable of restoration.
Far superior to it in preservation is that of Lustleigh,
which is of the same character as that of Bridford,
perhaps post-Reformation, and contains a series of
figures in the lower compartments representing clergy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
in their caps and surplices and "liripipets," and not
saints. There is some old glass in the church, in one
window a representation of S. Margaret. There are
monumental effigies in the church of the Prouze
family. One of these is of Sir William Prouze, to
whom the manor of Lustleigh belonged. By his will he
directed that he should be buried with his ancestors
at Lustleigh; but he died at a distance, and was
interred at Holbeton. Some time after, the wishes
of her father having come to the knowledge of Lady
Alice, the wife of Sir Roger Mules, Baron of Cadbury,
and finding that they had been disregarded, the dutiful
daughter petitioned Grandisson, Bishop of Exeter in
1329, that the remains might be removed from Holbeton
to Lustleigh, and the prayer was granted.</p>

<p>Forming the sill of the south door is a long
granite stone with a Romano-British inscription,
the reading of which has not been satisfactorily
made out.</p>

<p>In the chancel may be noticed the stone brackets,
perforated for the cords employed for the suspension
of the Lenten veil.</p>

<p>A story associated with Lustleigh church has its
parallels elsewhere. After it had been built the
devil threatened to destroy it, stained glass and all,
unless he were given a sacrifice. Now it happened
that a bumpkin was present in the churchyard with
a pack of cards in his pocket, and the Evil One
immediately demanded him as his due; but the
man, with great presence of mind, pounced on a
cat that was stalking by and dashed out its brains
against the wall of the porch. This satisfied the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
powers of darkness, and the consecration of the
church followed. The story is a clumsy late cooking
up of the old belief that before a building could be
occupied a life must be sacrificed to the telluric
deities. A horse, a dog, a sow&mdash;in this case a cat
was offered up. Echoes of the same are found
everywhere.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Most Devonshire churchyards were
formerly supposed to be haunted by some animal or
other, which had been buried under the cornerstone.
When S. Columba took possession of Iona the question
arose as to who was to die and be buried so as
to secure the place for ever to the community. One
of his monks, Oran by name, offered himself, and he
was buried alive under the foundations of the new
abbey.</p>

<p>The rectory house possesses its ancient hall open
to the roof. In the hedge between the church and
station is the "Bishop's Stone," a large block, bearing
the arms of Bishop Stapeldon (1307-26), who was
murdered in the riots occasioned by Edward II.
favouring the Despensers. He was fallen on by the
London mob in Cheapside, stripped, and beheaded
by them.</p>

<p>Strewn about Lustleigh are numerous masses of
granite, rounded, and like loaves of bread. This
is due to the weathering of the granite, which is
soft, but some, if not most, appear to have been
carried to where they lie by water.</p>

<p>The stream Becka forms a fall into the valley of
the Bovey, through woods, but except in very rainy
weather it is insignificant, and hardly merits to be
considered a waterfall; it is properly only a water-trickle.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>HOUND TOR</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>The eastern flank of the moor is infinitely richer
in vegetation than the western. The whole of Dartmoor
stands up as a wall against the prevalent
north-west and south-west winds that distort the
trees on the west side. Moreover, owing to the
shelter thus furnished, and to the disintegration of
the granite trending in this direction so as to form
deep beds of gravel, the valleys and hillsides are
clothed with rich vegetation. Pines flourish.</p>

<p>Hound Tor is a noble mass of rocks. It derives
its name from the shape assumed by the blocks on
the summit, that have been weathered into forms resembling
the heads of dogs peering over the natural
battlements, and listening to hear the merry call
of the horn. Below it, on the Manaton side, nestles
Hound Tor Farm, picturesquely enfolded in a sycamore
grove.</p>

<p>The sycamore, by the way, is peculiarly the tree
for Dartmoor and other exposed situations. The
beech cowers and turns from the blast, and it
divides so soon as its taproot touches rock; but the
sycamore stands up, indifferent to wind and rain,
to which it opposes the broad green leaves that it
turns against the blast, and so shelters itself as with
scale armour.</p>

<p>On Hound Tor is a circle of stones containing
a kistvaen.</p>

<p>The road that leads to Widdecombe and Ashburton
ascends to Hound Tor; but there is another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
road to Ashburton by Hey Tor that branches off to
the left before Hound Tor Farm is reached, and
scrambles up to Trendlebere Down, passing an
almost destroyed stone row starting from a cairn
beside the highway. The road runs at a great
elevation (1,080 feet) for some miles. There is a
pleasant and homely inn at Hey Tor Vale, where
the traveller may rest and gather strength to visit
Holwell Tor and Hey Tor Rocks. Holwell Tor was
at one time surrounded by a stone rampart, but
quarrymen have sadly injured it, and it is not now
easy to decide whether the inclosure was merely
a pound, like Grimspound, or a stone camp, like
Whit Tor.</p>

<p>Hey Tor Rocks form two fine masses, and are unlike
most of the moorland tors, in that the granite is
very consistent, and is not broken into the usual
layers of soft beds alternating with hard layers. The
view of the valley below Hey Tor and Grea Tor
on one side, and the ridge of Bone Hill on the
other, is fine.</p>

<p>The road, commanding to the east a vast stretch
of the rich lowlands of Devon, passes Saddle Tor
and reaches Rippon Tor, where is a good logan
stone. Here are several cairns much mutilated by
the road-makers. On the further side of the road,
by Pill Tor, are remains of an extensive prehistoric
settlement. Many huts and inclosures remain. The
place bears the name of Foale's Arrishes, from a
man of that appellation who spent his energies in
converting the prehistoric inclosures into fields for
his own use, to the destruction of much that was
interesting, and to his own very dubitable advantage.
The huts have, however, yielded fine specimens
of ornamented pottery. The decoration is here and
there made with a woman's finger-nail. Consider
that! Some poor barbaric squaw five thousand years
ago fashioned the damp clay with her hands and
devised a rude pattern, which she incised with her
nails. She is long ago gone to dust, and her dust
dispersed, but the impress of her nails remains.</p>

<p>This is much like what we are all doing, and doing
unconsciously&mdash;leaving little finger-touches on our
creations, giving shape to the minds and habits of
our children and of those with whom we are brought
into contact, shaping, adorning, or disfiguring our
epoch, and the impressions we leave are indelible;
they will in turn be transmitted to ages to come.</p>

<p>Some of the ornamentation, as in a specimen from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
Smallacombe Rocks, is made with a twisted cord.
The pottery is all hand-made, shaped without the
wheel, and very imperfectly burnt. It is not red,
because there was little iron in the clay.</p>

<p>One large hut at Foale's Arrishes had a seat carried
round part at least of the interior, made of branches
that were held from spreading by sharp stones planted
upright in the floor. The kitchen was on the left side
of the entrance in a subsidiary structure.</p>

<p>It has, of late, become a thing not unusual for
young fellows, if suffering from delicacy of the lungs,
to rent or buy a farm on Dartmoor. No research
after parasitic microbes thenceforth concerns them.
The fresh air, the constant exercise, the joyous
existence on the wild moor are fatal to tubercular
bacteria. Rude health, buoyant spirits, unflagging
energy result from such treatment.</p>

<p>It is, it must be admitted, surpassing hard to
induce servants from the "in-country" to take
situations on Dartmoor. The air there is as unsuited
to them as to other microbes. But the settler
lights his own fires, cooks his own meals, makes his
own bed; and, as one of them assured me, his
experience proved to him that a man can keep a
hunter at the same cost as he can a servant-maid:
therefore, why be worried with the latter?</p>

<p>At Post Bridge they have had a succession of
curates who have lived this life in cabins or hovels,
and have learned to love it. It has one drawback,
and one only&mdash;it makes the hands rough and grimy.
But what are gloves for, but to cover dirty hands
when we go to town to make display?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>As to food. Rabbits are to be had at any moment;
geese, ducks live and luxuriate on the moor; an
occasional blackcock or moorhen and a brace of
snipe give zest; and trout are to be obtained for
the labour or pleasure of angling for them. The
price of horses is mounting; any number may be
grown on the moor. Sheep, cattle&mdash;you turn them
out, and they thrive on the sweet grass, and know
not the maladies that afflict flocks and herds in the
world twelve hundred feet below.</p>

<p>Let it not be supposed that in winter Dartmoor
is a desolation and a horror. It is by no means an
unpleasant place for a sojourn then. When below
are mud and mist, aloft on the moor the ground is
hard with frost and the air crisp and clear. Down
below we are oppressed with the fall of the leaf,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
affecting us, if inclined to asthma and bronchitis;
and in the short, dull days of December and January
our spirits wax dark amidst naked trees and when
our ankles are deep in mud. There are no trees on
Dartmoor to expose their naked limbs, and tell us
that vegetation is dead. The shoulders of down are
draped in brown sealskin mantles&mdash;the ling and
heather, as lovely in its sleep as in its waking state;
the mosses, touched by frost, turn to rainbow hues.
For colour effects give me Dartmoor in winter.</p>

<p>And then the peat fires! What fires can surpass
them? They do not flame, but they glow, and
diffuse an aroma that fills the lungs with balm.
The turf-cutting is one of the annual labours on
the moor. Every farm has its peat-bog, and in the
proper season a sufficiency of fuel is cut, then carried
and stacked for winter use. I may be mistaken, but
it seems to me that cooking done over a peat fire
surpasses cooking at the best club in London. But
it may be that on the moor one relishes a meal in a
manner impossible elsewhere.</p>

<p>Widdecombe-in-the-Moor is a village in a valley
walled off from the world by high ridges on the east
and on the west. The entire bed of the valley has
been washed and rewashed by streamers for tin.
Bag Park is a gentleman's seat laid out on this collection
of refuse, and the pines and firs luxuriate in
the granite rubble and grow, as if it were to them
a pleasure to thrust up their leaders and expand their
boughs.</p>

<p>I shall never forget a drive through Widdecombe
one October day, when the sun was shining bright,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
and the air was soft. The sycamores had shed their
leaves; but the expedition was one through coral
land. The rowan or mountain-ash, which was everywhere,
was burdened with clusters of scarlet berries,
and the hedges were wreathed with rose-hips and
dense with ruddy haws.</p>

<p>The church of Widdecombe has a very fine tower,
built, it is said, by the tinners. The roof has many
of the original bosses, carved and painted with
heads, flowers, and leaves. One has the figure on it
of S. Catherine with her wheel. One boss has on
it three rabbits, each with a single ear, which unite in
the centre, forming a triangle. One exactly similar
is in Tavistock church.</p>

<p>Part of the lower portion of the roodscreen remains
with figures of saints on it.</p>

<p>The story of the great thunderstorm in which
Widdecombe church was struck, on Sunday, October
21st, 1638, when the congregation were present
at divine service, has often been told, notably by
Mr. Blackmore in his novel <cite>Christowel</cite>.</p>

<p>Prince, in his <cite>Worthies of Devon</cite>, thus narrates
the circumstances:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In the afternoon, in service time, there happened a
very great darkness, which still increased to that degree,
that they could not see to read; soon after, a terrible and
fearful thunder was heard, like the noise of so many great
guns, accompanied with dreadful lightning, to the great
amazement of the people; the darkness still increasing,
that they could not see each other, when there presently
came such an extraordinary flame of lightning, as filled the
church with fire, smoak, and a loathsome smell, like brim-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>stone;
a ball of fire came in likewise at the window, and
passed through the church, which so affrighted the congregation,
that most of them fell down in their seats; some
upon their knees, others on their faces, and some one upon
another, crying out of burning and scalding, and all giving
themselves up for dead. There were in all four persons
killed, and sixty-two hurt, divers of them having their linen
burnt, tho' their outward garments were not so much as
singed.... The church itself was much torn and defaced
with the thunder and lightning, a beam whereof, breaking
in the midst, fell down between the minister and clerk, and
hurt neither. The steeple was much wrent; and it was
observed where the church was most torn, there the least
hurt was done among the people. There was none hurted
with the timber or stone; but one man, who, it was judged,
was killed by the fall of a stone."</p></div>

<p>The monument of this man, Roger Hill, is in
the church, as also an account in verse of the storm,
composed by the village schoolmaster.</p>

<p>For many years the incumbent of Widdecombe
was a man who was reputed to be the son of
George IV. when Prince Regent. His sister, married
to a captain, who deserted her, occupied a cottage,
now in ruins, under Crockern Tor. She also was
believed to be of blood-royal with a bar sinister.
Both the parson and his sister had been brought
up about Court. He, when given the living of
Widdecombe&mdash;- to get him out of sight and mind&mdash;brought
with him a large consignment of excellent
port, and that drew to his parsonage such rare men
as would brave the moors and storms for the sake
of a carouse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>His sister, in the desolate cottage under Crockern
Tor, languished and died, leaving her only child,
Caroline, to the charge of her uncle. She was sent
for her education to a famous school in Queen's
Square, London, where she associated with girls
belonging to families of the first rank.</p>

<p>A certain air of distinction, as well as the story
that circulated relative to her mother's origin, made
her an object of interest, and her imperious manner
commanded respect.</p>

<p>The vicarage was by no means a good place in
which a young girl should grow to maturity. The
house was not frequented by men of the best
character, and the wildest stories are told of the
goings-on there in the forties and fifties.</p>

<p>Caroline was, however, a girl of exceptionally
strong character; she was early called on to hold
her own with the associates of her uncle and frequenters
of the vicarage, and she was quite able to
enforce upon them a proper behaviour towards
herself.</p>

<p>Unhappily, she had been reared without any
religious principles; her law was consequently her
own caprice, fortunately held in check by a strong
sense of personal dignity.</p>

<p>The position she was in was as forlorn and unpromising
as any in which a young girl could find
herself.</p>

<p>She was full of generous impulses, but they were
wholly untrained; she possessed furious passions,
which were held in check solely by her pride. She
would do at one time a generous act and next a dirty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
trick, "just," as the people said, "as though she were
a pixy."</p>

<p>A gentleman named Darke, visiting her uncle on
some business, married Caroline, and soon after her
uncle died suddenly, having made a will in her
favour.</p>

<p>The vicarage was well furnished and contained
articles of great value, in pictures, plate, etc., supposed
to have been presented to him, but most likely
obtained with money lent at Court to those temporarily
embarrassed.</p>

<p>The manor had been sold, and was purchased by
Mrs. Darke's trustees at her request, and from that
time she insisted on being entitled "Lady" Darke;
and into this she moved with her dogs, horses, and
husband.</p>

<p>This latter had soon discovered what an imperious
character she possessed. His will might clash with
hers, but hers would never give way. Her character
was the toughest and most energetic, and by degrees
he fell into a condition of submission and insignificance
which it was painful to witness, and which
"Lady" Darke herself resented, without being aware
that it was due to her own overbearing behaviour.</p>

<p>She kept nine or ten horses in her stables&mdash;some
had never been broken in; some she rode on, others
were driven in pairs. But towards the end of her
life the horses were not taken out, and ate their
heads off many times over.</p>

<p>If a visitor of distinction was expected, she sent
for him her carriage and pair with silver-mounted
harness. For ordinary use she employed her <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>brass-mounted
harness; but Bill, her husband, was despatched
to market in the little trap in which she
fetched coals. Latterly Mr. Darke was sent to make
purchases at Ashburton, with a long list of "chores,"
<em>i.e.</em> of articles he was to bring back with him, written
out during the week on a slip of paper from a
pocket-book. Here is one: "Kidney-beans and
cucumbers; tea, and green paint with driers; brushes
and putty; sweets; and a frock-body for myself; a
milkpan, fourteen inches; side-combs, 3<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em>; ostler's
boy and fish; lavender; pain-killer; wine, salad oil,
harness paste, and rice; also ribs of beef, grate for
blue bedroom, india-rubber; rabbits, grind scissors,
cheese, inn and ostler."</p>

<p>She ruled her husband, and indeed everyone with
whom she came in contact. He, cut off from social
intercourse with his fellows, out of the current of
intellectual life, with no other work to do than to
fulfil her behests, sank in his own estimation, and fell
into degradation without making an effort to rise out
of it.</p>

<p>An instance of her despotic character may be
given. One day she wanted to have her hay made;
she was anxious lest a change of weather should
come on. She issued an imperious order to the curate
of the parish to come and help save the hay. He
sent an apology. This rendered her furious. She
went in quest of him, met him in the village, and
falling on him soundly boxed his ears in public.</p>

<p>She was an implacable hater; and living on the
wilds, half educated, she was superstitious, and believed
in witchcraft, and in her own power to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>ill-wish
such individuals as offended her. She was
caught on one occasion with a doll into which she
was sticking pins and needles, in the hope and with
the intent thereby of producing aches and cramps in
a neighbour. On another occasion she laid a train of
gunpowder on her hearth, about a figure of dough,
and ignited it, for the purpose of conveying an
attack of fever to the person against whom she was
animated with resentment.</p>

<p>It need hardly be said that believing in her own
powers others believed in them as well, and dreaded
offending her.</p>

<p>She was kind-hearted, and impulsive in her
generosity. She divided the parish into two halves&mdash;one
she gave over to the doctor and kept the other
to herself. "He kills with his physic," she said, "I
keep alive and recover with my soups and port wine."</p>

<p>She was vastly angry with the vicar, her uncle's
successor, about some trifle, and she went after him
with her whip and threatened to chastise him with
it. He actually summoned her, and swore that he
lived in bodily fear of the lady.</p>

<p>She liked to have visitors drop in on her, but not
to be warned of their coming; for she took a pride
in showing what she could provide for table on the
spur of the moment; and forth would come a ham,
half a goose, a boiled leg of mutton, a big cheese
and celery, produced as by magic, and would be
served by herself in an old gown, red turnover handkerchief
on her shoulders, and a coal-scuttle bonnet
on her head.</p>

<p>Mrs. Darke at one time played on the piano after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
the meal to get her guests to dance, but the cats tore
the instrument open and made their nests and kittened
among the strings, and the damp air rusted the wires.
Then she bought a barrel-organ, and forced her
husband to turn the handle in the corner and grind
out the music for the dancers. However, on one
occasion, having tasted too often a bottle within
reach, though out of sight, he fell forward in the
middle of a dance and brought the instrument down
with him. The instrument was so broken that it
could no longer be used. Mr. Darke died at last in
one of the fits to which he was liable, having retired
to rest by mistake under in place of on the bed.</p>

<p>By this time the lady had become very deaf.</p>

<p>On hearing the news of the decease some friends
went to see her.</p>

<p>"Very grieved, madam, at your sad loss!"</p>

<p>"Ah! Bill is dead. He might have done worse;
he might have lived. You will stop and dine, of
course."</p>

<p>They had to tarry to see to matters of business.
"Now, look here," said "Lady" Darke, "I'll have no
more 'truck' with Bill. He has been trouble to me
long enough. I shall send him to his friends in
Plymouth. Let them bury him."</p>

<p>"Madam," said the nurse, "we want to lay him
out. Will you give me a sheet?"</p>

<p>"A sheet! One of my good linen sheets! Not I.
Take a pig-cloth"; that is to say, one in which bacon
was salted. And actually her husband was laid in
his coffin in one of these "pig-cloths."</p>

<p>In Mrs. Cudlip's novel, <cite>She Cometh Not, He Saith</cite>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
is a description of a meeting with the lady that is
very true to life, as is also the account of the downstairs
arrangement of the manor house.</p>

<p>In later years "Lady" Darke became infirm. She
neglected everything, and no one dared do anything
in the house without her orders. Until she came
downstairs in the morning there could be no breakfast,
as she kept the keys. The house was infested
with cats and dogs, and her servants did not dare
to get rid of any of them, or to drive them out of the
rooms. The large room over the kitchen she alone
entered. The door was padlocked, and the key of
the padlock she kept attached to her garter. Thence
the key had to be taken after her death to obtain
admission. It was found to contain a confused mass
of sundry articles to the depth of three feet above the
floor, the accumulation of many years. Bureaus were
there with guineas and banknotes in the drawers,
and quantities of old silver plate, bearing the arms
and crests of men of title who had been about the
Court of the Prince Regent; and the whole was
veiled in cobwebs that hung from the ceiling so long
and so dense as to hide the further extremity of the
chamber.</p>

<p>"Lady" Darke retained her imperious disposition
to the end; it was in vain that it was suggested to
her that she should have an attendant to be always
with her. She often sat up the whole night by her
fire, and her servants dared not retire to bed till their
mistress had given the signal that they were to
depart.</p>

<p>Of relations she had none; at least none who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
came near her, and when she was dead much
difficulty was found in discovering any persons who
had claim to her inheritance.</p>

<p>She died quite suddenly, and left no will.</p>

<p>Her trustees had to advertise before they could
find relations, and then those who presented themselves
were the children of her father by a third
wife. Her dogs and cats were first killed, then
several old horses that were dragging themselves
about the field in extreme old age.</p>

<p>Her plate and pictures were sold.</p>

<p>To the best of my knowledge no portrait of her
remains.</p>

<p>She was a fine woman, and must at one time have
been handsome. It was fancied by many that her
features bore a resemblance to the pictures of
George IV. in his young days. The mystery
relative to her mother and uncle was never solved,
and it is possible enough that the supposed paternity
was due to idle gossip.</p>

<p>There were vast collections of letters among the
remains, but these were all destroyed, and nothing
was allowed to transpire as to their contents.</p>

<p>The story from beginning to end is one of infinite
sadness. It is of one with a remarkably strong but
undisciplined character, one full of good impulses,
who had never been taught religious duty, and given
no religious belief, who was therefore condemned to
waste a profitless life in a remote village, without
purpose, without self-discipline, without hope, without
God.</p>

<p>There are some interesting old farmhouses about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
Widdecombe; one is at Chittleford, another on
Corndon. The primitive type of farm on the moor
was an inclosed courtyard, entered through a gate.
Opposite the gate is the dwelling-house, with a
projecting porch, with an arched granite door and a
mullioned window over it. On one side of the
entrance is the dwelling-room, on the other the
saddle and sundry chamber. The well, which is a
stream of water from the moor conducted by a small
leat to the house, is under cover; and the cattle-sheds
open into the yard, so as to be reached with ease
from the house without exposure to the storms.</p>

<p>These farm dwellings are rapidly disappearing,
and are making way for more pretentious and extremely
hideous buildings. Such as remain are
remarkably picturesque, and should be photographed
before they are destroyed.</p>

<p>Widdecombe must not be quitted without a reference
to the famous ballad of the old grey mare taken
there to the fair; a ballad that is immensely popular
in Devon, and one to the air of which the Devon
Regiment went against the Boers.</p>

<p>Now it does not appear from the song <em>why</em> the
mare was so dead beat. But a clever American
artist, who has illustrated the song, has brought her
knowledge of human nature to bear on the story.
She has shown in her pictures how that the borrower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
of the horse met with a pretty gipsy girl at the fair,
and persuaded her to ride away with him <i lang="fr">en croupe</i>.
This explains at once why the horse was so overcome
that it "fell sick and died."</p>

<p>One can understand also how that this ballad
being a man's song, a veil is delicately thrown over
this incident.</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>From the vicarage garden a noble view of the
windings of the Dart through Holne Chase is to
be obtained&mdash;permission asked and given.</p>

<p>To see Holne Chase, it should be ascended as far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
as New Bridge, and thence descended through the
Buckland Drives. Permission is given on fixed days.</p>

<p>In Holne Wood, where the river makes a loop, is
an early camp, with indications of hut circles in it,
but thrown out of shape by the trees growing in the
area. Near the entrance charcoal-burners have
formed their hole in which to burn the timber. A
finer and better preserved camp is Hembury.</p>

<p>In the Chase, on the Buckland side under Awsewell
Rock, are the remains of furnaces and great heaps of
slag. The point is where there is a junction of the
granite and the sedimentary rocks. Above the wooded
flank of the hill, the rocks are pierced and honeycombed
by miners following veins of ore, probably
copper. The workings are very primitive, and
deserve inspection. The little village of Buckland
should not be neglected. It is marvellously picturesque,
but the houses do not appear to be healthy,
being buried in foliage. The church has not been
restored. It possesses an old screen with curious
paintings, some impossible to interpret; and it is in
the old bepewed, neglected condition familiar now
only to those whose years number something about
sixty or seventy. Buckland-in-the-Moor is the full
name of this parish, but it is no longer in the moor.
Colonel Bastard, ancestor of the present owner,
planted all the heathery land and hillsides with
trees, and received therefor the thanks of Parliament
as one who by so doing had deserved well of his
country.</p>

<p>If Holne Chase be beautiful, so is the Dart above
New Bridge. A more interesting drive can hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
be taken than one branching off from the main road
before reaching Pound's Gate and following a grassy
track called "Dr. Blackall's Drive," that sweeps round
the heights above the Dart and rejoins the road
between Mel Tor and Sharpie Tor.</p>

<p>But to see the Dart valley in perfection the river
should be followed up on foot from New Bridge to
that of Dartmeet, and thence up to Post Bridge.</p>

<p>The descent to Dartmeet by the road is one of
over five hundred feet. Halfway is the Coffin-stone,
on which five crosses are cut, and which is split in
half&mdash;the story goes, by lightning. On this it is
customary to rest a dead man on his way from the
moor beyond Dartmeet to his final resting-place at
Widdecombe. When the coffin is laid on this stone,
custom exacts the production of the whisky bottle,
and a libation all round to the manes of the deceased.</p>

<p>One day a man of very evil life, a terror to his
neighbours, was being carried to his burial, and his
corpse was laid on the stone whilst the bearers
regaled themselves. All at once, out of a passing
cloud shot a flash, and tore the coffin and the dead
man to pieces, consuming them to cinders, and
splitting the stone. Do you doubt the tale? See
the stone cleft by the flash.</p>

<p>Among the many hundreds who annually visit
Dartmeet, I do not suppose that more than one
sees the real beauties to which this spot opens the
way. Actually, Dartmeet Bridge is situated at
the least interesting and least picturesque point
on the river.</p>

<p>To know the Dart and see its glories, a visitor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
must desert the bridge and ascend the river. I
will indicate to him two walks, each of remarkable
beauty and each an easy one.</p>

<p>The first is this: Ascend the Dart on the <em>left</em>.
This can be done by passing through a gate
above Dartmeet Cottage, and descending to the
river, where remain a few of the venerable oaks that
once abounded at Brimpts, but were wantonly cut
down at the beginning of this century. Ascend
by a fisherman's path through the plantation to
where the wood ends, and the hills falling back
reveal a pleasant meadow, with, rising out of it
by the river, a holt or pile of rocks overgrown with
oaks. The view from this is beautiful. Proceeding
half a mile a ruined cottage is reached, where the
stately Yar Tor may be seen to advantage. This
ruin is called Dolly's Cot.</p>

<p>Dolly, who has given her name to this ruin, was a
somewhat remarkable woman. She lived with her
brother, orphans, by Princetown when Sir Thomas
Tyrwhitt settled at Tor Royal. She was a remarkably
handsome girl, and she seems to have caught
the eye of this gentleman, who located her and her
brother in the lodge, and then, as the brother kept a
sharp look-out on his sister, he got rid of him by
obtaining for him an appointment in the House of
Lords, where he looked after the lighting, and had
as his perquisite the ends of the wax tapers. As
fresh candles were provided every day, and the
sessions were at times short, the perquisites were
worth a good deal.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>However, if the brother were away Dolly had
another to watch over her, one Tom Trebble, a
young and handsome moorman, who did not at all
relish the manner in which Sir Thomas, Warden
of the Stannaries, hovered about Miss Dolly.</p>

<p>But a climax was reached when the Prince Regent
arrived at Tor Royal to visit his forest of Dartmoor.
The Prince's eye speedily singled Dolly out, and the
blue coat and brass buttons, white ducks tightly
strapped, and the curled-brimmed hat were to be
seen on the way to Dolly's cottage a little too frequently
to please Tom Trebble. So to cut his
anxieties short he whisked Dolly on to the pillion
of his moor cob and rode off with her to Lydford,
where they were married. Then he carried her away
to this cottage&mdash;now a ruin&mdash;on the Dart, to which
led no road, hardly a path even, and where she was
likely to be out of the way of both the Prince and
his humble servant, Sir Thomas.</p>

<p>In this solitary cottage Tom and Dolly lived for
many years. She survived her husband, and gained
her livelihood by working at the tin-mine of Hexworthy,
where one of the shafts recently sunk was
named after her.</p>

<p>The candle-snuffer realised&mdash;so it was said&mdash;a
good fortune out of the wax taper-ends, and never
returned to Dartmoor.</p>

<p>Dolly lived to an advanced age, and even as an
old woman was remarkably handsome and of a
distinguished appearance.</p>

<p>It is now difficult to collect authentic information
concerning her, as only very old people remember
Dolly. She was buried at Widdecombe, and aged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
moor folk still speak of her funeral, at which all
the women mourners wore white skirts, <em>i.e.</em> their
white petticoats <em>without</em> the coloured skirts of their
gowns, and white kerchiefs pinned as crossovers to
cover their shoulders.</p>

<p>The distance is between six and seven miles.
Dolly was borne to her grave by the tin-miners,
and followed not only by the mine-workers, but
by all the women of the moorside, and all in
their white petticoats; and as they went they
sang psalms.</p>

<p>From Dolly's Cot the hill can be ascended to
"The Seven Sisters," seven conspicuous old Scotch
pines, whereof one has lost its head. Thence a
road is reached that takes a visitor back to Dartmeet
by Brimpts.</p>

<p>The other walk, even finer, is this: Ascend the
hill on the Ashburton road till a road breaks away
to the left to Sherrill. Follow this, when on the <em>col</em>
a kistvaen, inclosed in a circle, is reached. North of
this is a much-ruined set of stone rows, three parallel
lines running 660 feet, but so plundered that only
158 stones remain. The road descends to a pleasant
little settlement, Sherrill, or Sher-well, consisting of
a farm and some cottages. The Sher-well bursts
out in one strong spring beside the road, and becomes
a good stream almost directly.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/p199.jpg" width="700" height="469" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>YAR TOR</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>The situation is warm and sheltered, and the
ground is cultivated. The road descends to the
Wallabrook, which it crosses, to Babeney. Thence
a track leads down the Wallabrook to its junction
with the Dart, where is disclosed what I hold to be one
of the finest, if not the finest view on Dartmoor.
A tract of level pasture lies at the junction of
the streams, and from this Yar Tor soars up a
veritable mountain. Few of the Dartmoor heights
are so situated as to show themselves to such advantage.
On the right, a spur well clothed in dark
fir plantations comes down from Brimpts; and on
the left is a clitter of bold granite rocks. The time
to visit this is certainly the evening, when Yar Tor is
bathed in a golden glory, and the woods are steeped
in royal purple.</p>

<p>Thence a path, or track rather, leads down the Dart
on the east side, past Badgers' Holt to the bridge.</p>

<p>And perhaps on the way the <i lang="la">Graphis scripta</i> may be
found, but it is chiefly to be discovered on old hollies,
a mysterious writing, characters scrawled by delicate
hands, and understandable only by the pixies, who
are credited with thus writing their messages to one
another. Actually this is a lichen, that strangely
affects a script.</p>

<p>It was at Badgers' Holt that old Dan Leaman
lived, on whom a trick was played which I have
already related in my <cite>Book of the West</cite>.</p>

<p>What a solitary life must have been led by the
occupants of the scattered farms and cottages at
Babeney, Sherrill, Dury, and the like, in former times!
And yet those who occupied them got to love the
isolation. A woman at Sherrill, who had been in
service and had married a moorman, said to me, "I
wouldn't live here if I could help it; but, Lor' bless y',
my old man, there's no gettin' he away from atop o'
Widdecombe chimney"&mdash;that is to say, the level of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
church tower. The reach of its bells formed the
world&mdash;the only world in which he cared to live. In
a cottage near Sherrill lived an old woman absolutely
alone, who for sixty years never once allowed her fire
to go out.</p>

<p>If it be desired to open out Dartmoor, a road
should be carried up the Dart from New Bridge to
Dartmeet, and thence, still following the river, to
Post Bridge. The owners of the banks of the Dart
below New Bridge to Holne Bridge&mdash;in fact, of Holne
Chase&mdash;could then hardly refuse to allow it to be
carried through their land to Holne Bridge, and then
a drive would be created passing through scenery
unsurpassed in England. Another ought to be
engineered up the Webburn from its meet with the
Dart, past Lizwell to Widdecombe; then that solitary
village would be at once accessible, and brought into
the world.</p>

<p>Below Dartmeet Bridge, if the river be followed
on the right through a wood, the Pixy Holt is
reached, a cave in which the little good folk are
supposed to dwell. It is the correct thing to leave
a pin or some other trifle in acknowledgment when
visiting their habitation.</p>

<p>Where the Okebrook drops into the West Dart
is an old blowing-house, with moulds for the tin,
ruined, and with a stout oak growing up in the
midst. There are also mortar-stones in the ruin.
Above Huccaby Bridge are the remains of a fine
circle of standing stones that has been sadly mutilated.
Another, far more perfect, is at Sherberton.</p>

<p>Near the bridge is Jolly Lane Cot, the house of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
Sally Satterleigh, that was built and occupied in
one day. Her father was desirous of marrying a
wife and bringing her to a home; but he had no
home to which to introduce her, and the farmers
round not only would afford no help, but proved
obstructive. One day when it was Holne Revel, and
the farmers had gone thither, the labouring people
assembled in swarms, set to work and built up the
cottage, and before the farmers returned, lively with
drink, from the revel, the man was in the cottage
and had lighted a fire on the hearth, and this constituted
a freeholding from which no man might
dispossess him. This man was a notable singer,
and his old daughter, now a grandmother, remembered
some of his songs. One wild and stormy
day, Mr. Bussell, of Brazen Nose College, now Dr.
Bussell and tutor of his college, drove over with me
from Princetown to get her songs from her.</p>

<p>But old Sally could not sit down and sing. We
found that the sole way in which we could extract
the ballads from her was by following her about as
she did her usual work. Accordingly we went after
her when she fed the pigs, or got sticks from the
firewood rick, or filled a pail from the spring, pencil
and notebook in hand, dotting down words and
melody. Finally she did sit to peel some potatoes,
when Mr. Bussell with a MS. music-book in hand,
seated himself on the copper. This position he
maintained as she sang the ballad of "Lord Thomas
and the Fair Eleanor," till her daughter applied fire
under the cauldron, and Mr. Bussell was forced to
skip from his perch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>Holne forms the extreme eastern end of a long
ridge that terminates to the west in Down Tor. This
hog's back stands over 1,500 feet above the sea, and is
the watershed. From it stream the Avon, the Erme,
the Yealm, and the Plym in a southerly direction,
and north of it are the West Dart and the Swincombe
river. It is a rounded back of moor, without
granite tors, thickly sown with bogs. But there is
a track, the Sandy Way, that threads these morasses
from Holne, and leads to Childe's Tomb, a kistvaen,
with a cross near it.</p>

<p>The story is well known.</p>

<p>A certain Childe, a hunter, lost his way in winter
in this wilderness. Snow fell thick and his horse
could go no further.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>
<p>The story goes on to say that when the monks
of Buckfast heard of this they made ready to transport
the body to their monastery. But the monks
of Tavistock were beforehand with them; they threw
a bridge over the Tavy, ever after called Guile
Bridge, and carried the dead Childe to their abbey.
Thenceforth they possessed the Plymstock estate.</p>

<p>The kistvaen is, of course, not Childe's grave, for
it is prehistoric, and Childe was not buried there.
But the cross may have been set up to mark the spot
where he was found.</p>

<p>Childe's Cross was quite perfect, standing on a
three-stepped pedestal, till in or about 1812, when it
was nearly destroyed by the workmen of a Mr.
Windeatt, who was building a farmhouse near by.
The stones that composed it have, however, been for
the most part recovered, and the cross has been
restored as well as might be under the circumstances.</p>

<p>The Sandy Way was doubtless a very ancient track
across the moor from east to west, as it is marked
by crosses, as may be judged by the Ordnance map.
1, Horne's Cross; 2 and 3, crosses on Down Ridge;
4 and 5, crosses on Terhill; 6 and 7, crosses near Fox
Tor, in the Newtake; 8, Childe's Cross; 9, Seward's
or Nun's Cross; 10, cross on Walkhampton Common.</p>

<p>Swincombe, formerly Swan-combe, runs to the
north of the ridge, and has the sources of its river
in the Fox Tor mires and near Childe's Tomb.</p>

<p>It runs north-east, and then abruptly passes north
to decant into the West Dart.</p>

<p>Near this is Gobbetts Mine, a very interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
spot, for here are samples of the modern deep mining
shaft, the shallow workings, and the deep, open cuttings
of the earlier times, and the stream works of
the "old men." Thus we have on one spot a compendium
of the history of mining for tin. Among
the relics lying about are the remains of an old
crazing-mill, consisting of the upper and the nether
stones. The nether stone is 3 feet 10 inches in
diameter, and 10 inches thick. In the periphery is a
groove forming a lip, that served readily to discharge
the ground material.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
<img src="images/p204.jpg" width="550" height="444" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>CRAZING-MILL STONE, UPPER GOBBETTS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The upper stone has a roughly convex back, and
an eye as well as four holes drilled in it. Into these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
holes posts were fitted, which carried two bars, so
that the stone was made to revolve by horse or man
power, like the arrangement of a capstan.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/p205.jpg" width="700" height="307" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>METHOD OF USING THE MILL-STONES. SECTION.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The hole or eye of the nether stone was for the
purpose of receiving a conical plug, the apex of
which penetrated partly into the eye of the upper
stone, and served the double purpose of keeping the
runner stone in position and of distributing the feed
equally on the grinding-surfaces. To further assist
this are four curved master-furrows or grooves, radiating
from the eye of the grinding-surface of the upper
stone. The mill, worked by men or by horses, was
of slow speed, and water was introduced to assist
the propulsion of the ground material towards the
grooved lip in the periphery of the stone. This and
the feed were, of course, introduced through the
circular hole in the top stone.</p>

<p>On the site of what was evidently the blowing-house
is a mould-stone, about 4 feet by 3. The
mould is 15 inches long by 11 inches wide at one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
end, and 10 inches at the other, and 4 to 5 inches
deep. There are also cavities for sample ingots.</p>

<p>Other stones lie about with hollows worked in
them, that seem to have been mortar-stones, used
for pounding up the ore, at a period earlier than that
at which the crazing-mill was introduced.</p>

<p>Further up the Swincombe, on the left, a little
stream descends that has had its bed turned over
and over. This is Deep Swincombe, and here are
the remains of the earliest known smelting-house
yet noticed on Dartmoor. It has been fully described
in a previous chapter. On all sides we
discover traces of those who in ancient times came
to Dartmoor and toiled after metal. We go in
swarms there now&mdash;to spend our metal and idle and
gain health. So the old order changeth, and with
it men's moods and manners.</p>

<p>To return to Holne. In the parsonage Charles
Kingsley was born, but the house has since been to
a large extent rebuilt. On a fly-sheet of the Book of
Burial Registers is the entry, "The Vicarage House,
being very <em>dilapidated</em>, was taken down and rebuilt
by the Vicar (the Rev. John D. Parham) in the year
1832." It was in that "very dilapidated" house that
Charles Kingsley was born.</p>

<p>A curious custom existed at Holne, now given up.
There is, near the village, a "Ploy (play) Field" in
which stood formerly a rude granite stone six or
seven feet high.</p>

<p>On May morning, before daybreak, the young men
of the village were wont to assemble there and then
proceed to the moor, where they selected a ram lamb,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
and, after running it down, brought it in triumph
to the Ploy Field, fastened it to the granite post, cut
its throat, and then roasted it whole&mdash;skin, wool, etc.
At midday a struggle took place, at the risk of cut
hands, for a slice, it being supposed to confer luck
for the ensuing year on the fortunate devourer. As
an act of gallantry the young men sometimes fought
their way through the crowd to get a slice for the
chosen amongst the young women, all of whom, in
their best dresses, attended the Ram Feast, as it
was called. Dancing, wrestling, and other games,
assisted by copious libations of cider during the
afternoon, prolonged the festivity till midnight. This
is now entirely of the past, but a somewhat similar
popular festival survives at King's Teignton, or did
so till recently. There Whitsuntide is the season
chosen. A lamb is drawn about the parish on
Whitsun Monday in a cart covered with garlands
of lilac, laburnum, and other flowers, when persons
are requested to give something towards the animal
and attendant expenses. On Tuesday morning it is
killed and roasted whole in the middle of the village.
The lamb is then sold in slices to the poor at a
cheap rate. The story told to account for this
festival is that the village once suffered from a
dearth of water, when the inhabitants were advised
to pray for water; whereupon a fountain burst forth
in a meadow about a third of a mile above the river,
in an estate now called Rydon, a supply sufficient
to meet the necessities of the villagers. A lamb,
it is said, has ever since been sacrificed as a return
offering at Whitsuntide in the manner above mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>The said water appears like a large pond, from
which in rainy weather may be seen jets springing
up some inches above the surface in many parts.</p>

<p>I know the case of a farmer on the edge of
Dartmoor, whose cattle were afflicted with some
disorder in 1879; he thereupon conveyed a sheep to
the ridge above his house, sacrificed and burnt it
there, as an offering to the Pysgies. The cattle at
once began to recover, and did well after, nor were
there any fresh cases of sickness amongst them.
Since then I have been told of other and very
similar cases.</p>

<p class="drop-capw"><span class="smcap">This</span> not very interesting spot may be chosen
as a centre whence the Avon, Erme, and Yealm
river valleys may be explored. The distances are
considerable, but the railway facilitates reaching
starting-points&mdash;South Brent for the Avon, and
Cornwood for the Yealm. It is advisable to ascend
one river, cross a ridge, and descend another river.</p>

<p>The moors on this, the south, side are by no means
so bold as are those on the other sides, but the valleys
are hardly to be surpassed for beauty; and they give
access to very remarkable groups of antiquities, the
distance to some of which beyond inclosed land,
and the absence of roads on this part of the moor
has saved these latter from destruction.</p>

<p>In Ivybridge itself there is absolutely nothing
worth seeing, but the churches of Ugborough and
Ermington richly deserve a visit; and there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
some old manor houses, as Fardell, Fillham, Slade,
and Fowelscombe, that may be seen with interest.
We will begin with the valley of the Avon.</p>

<p>South Brent is dominated by Brent Hill, that
was formerly crowned with a chapel dedicated to
S. Michael. The parish church, a foundation of
S. Petrock, possessed a fine carved oak screen.
The church has, however, been taken in hand by
that iconoclast the "restorer," who has left it empty,
swept and garnished&mdash;a thing of nakedness and a
woe for ever. The screen&mdash;the one glory of the
church&mdash;was cast forth into the graveyard, and there
allowed to rot.</p>

<p>The Avon foams down from the moor through a
contracted throat, affording scenes of great beauty
in its ravine. It receives the Glazebrook some way
below South Brent, and the Bala about the same
distance above it.</p>

<p>The river has to be ascended for two miles and
a half before Shipley Bridge is reached, and then
the moor is in front of one, with Zeal Plains spread
out, strewn with prehistoric settlements that have
not as yet been properly investigated.</p>

<p>The Abbots' Way, a track from Buckfast to
Tavistock, crosses the Avon at Huntingdon's Cross,
a rude un-chamfered stone four feet and a half high.
It stands immediately within the forest bounds. The
moors already traversed are the commons of Brent
and Dean. The cross is romantically situated in
a rocky basin, the rising ground about it covered
with patches of heather, with here and there a granite
boulder protruding through the turf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"All around is still and silent, save the low murmuring
of the waters as they run over their pebbly bed. The only
signs of life are the furry inhabitants of the warren, and,
perchance, a herd of Dartmoor ponies, wild as the country
over which they roam, and a few sheep or cattle grazing on
the slopes. The cross is surrounded by rushes, and a
dilapidated wall&mdash;the warren enclosure&mdash;runs near it."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p></div>

<p>The Abbots' Way may here be distinctly seen
ascending the left bank of the Avon.</p>

<p>On Quick Beam Hill, over which the Abbots' Way
climbs to reach the valley of the Erme, is another
cross, concerning which something must be said, as
it shows that not only educated and intelligent architects
are iconoclasts, but also illiterate and stupid
workmen.</p>

<p>There is a cairn that bears the name of Whitaburrow,
and till the year 1847, erect on it in the
centre stood an old grey moorstone cross. In that
year a company was formed to extract naphtha from
the peat, and its works were established near Shipley
Bridge, to which the peat was conveyed from this
spot in tram-waggons.</p>

<p>There being no place of shelter near, the labourers
erected a house on the summit of the cairn, which
measures one hundred and ninety feet in circumference,
and requiring a large stone as a support
for their chimney-breast, they knocked off the arms
of the cross and employed the shaft for that purpose.
The house has disappeared with the exception of the
foundations and about three feet in height of walling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
but the poor old maimed shaft stands there aloft, just
as the poor old maimed church of South Brent stands
on the river far below. Each has lost that which
made it significant and beautiful, each mutilated by
the stupidity of man.</p>

<p>The cross takes its name from Sir William Petre
of Tor Brian, who possessed certain rights over
Brent Moor. He was Secretary of State in four
reigns&mdash;those of Henry VIII., Edward VI., Mary, and
Elizabeth&mdash;and seems to have conformed to whichever
religion was favoured by the Sovereign, like the
Vicar of Bray. He died in 1571, and was the
ancestor of the present Lord Petre.</p>

<p>On Ugborough Moor, that adjoins, is a third cross,
called that of Hobajohn, which is planted, singularly
enough, in the midst of a stone row. This row
starts on Butterdon Hill, above Ivybridge, and passes
within a short distance of Sharp Tor. I have not
seen it, but learn that it, like most other stone rows,
starts from a cairn inclosed within upright stones.
It must, if really a stone row, be something like
three miles in length. The cross has also been
mutilated, and lies prostrate.</p>

<p>A fourth cross, Spurle's or Pearl's Cross, on
Ugborough Moor, has lost its shaft.</p>

<p>The Abbots' Way from Avon valley leads to the
Erme valley, where Redlake enters it at a very
interesting point. Here, at the junction of this
feeder, is a well-preserved blowing-house, with its
wheel-pit and with its tin-moulds lying in the ruins.</p>

<p>The whole of Erme Plains and the valley for three
miles down is simply crowded with hut circles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
pounds, and other remains. On the height above,
Staldon Moor, is a stone row of really astounding
length, of which something has been already said.
It starts at the south end from a large circle, which
formerly inclosed a cairn, and stretches away to
the north, over hill and down dale, for two miles
and a quarter, and terminates in a kistvaen. The
stones are not large, but the row is fairly intact.</p>

<p>Due south of this, on the south side of the highest
point of Stall Moor, Staldon Barrow, are two more
stone rows, almost, but not quite, in a line. In the
neighbourhood are many cairns and kistvaens.
The stones here are larger. Taken together the
rows run over 1,400 feet. They can be seen from
Cornwood Station when the light is favourable.</p>

<p>Again another row on Burford Down, a continuation
of the same moor, starts from a circle containing
a kistvaen near Tristis Rock, and stretches away
north to a wall and across an inclosed field, but here
it has been sadly pillaged for the construction of the
wall. It still runs 1,500 feet. The Erme valley has
been much worked by streamers, and some of the
mining operations have been carried on at a comparatively
recent period.</p>

<p>By the side of a little lateral gully on the right
hand in descending the river is a beehive hut among
the streamers' mounds; it is quite intact, and shelter
may be taken in it from a passing storm. It is,
however, not prehistoric, but is a miners' <em>cache</em>.</p>

<p>Another, also perfect, is a little further down, on
the other side of the river before reaching Piles
Wood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>Harford church, another foundation of S. Petrock,
stands high. It contains nothing of interest except
an altar tomb with brasses upon it, in memory of
Thomas Williams, Speaker of the House of Commons,
of the family of that name formerly resident at
Stowford, in the parish. And in the second place, a
monument to John and Agnes Prideaux, the parents
of John Prideaux, Bishop of Worcester. This was
set up by the latter in 1639.</p>

<p>Hall, not far from the church, was for some time
the residence of the notorious Elizabeth Chudleigh,
Duchess of Kingston, who was tried and condemned
for bigamy. It was a hard case. She was born in
1726, and was the daughter of Colonel Thomas
Chudleigh, who died when Elizabeth was quite a
child. In 1744, when she was aged only eighteen,
she visited her maternal aunt, Anne Hanmer, at
Lainston, near Winchester, met at the Winchester
Races Lieutenant Hervey, second son of Lord Hervey,
and grandson of the Earl of Bristol, who was then
aged twenty. He was invited to Lainston, and one
night in a foolish frolic, at eleven o'clock, with the
connivance, if not at the instigation, of Mrs. Hanmer,
Elizabeth was married to Lieutenant Hervey by the
rector in the little roofless ruin of a church. No
registers were signed, and the bridegroom left in
two days to rejoin his ship, and sailed for the West
Indies.</p>

<p>She never after that received Lieutenant Hervey
as her husband, and he instituted a suit in the
Consistory Court of the Bishop of London for the
jactitation of the marriage, and sentence was given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
in 1769 declaring that the marriage form gone
through in 1744 was null and void. On the
strength of this Elizabeth married the Duke of
Kingston, March 8, 1769.</p>

<p>No attempt was made during the lifetime of the
Duke to dispute the legality of the union; neither
he nor Elizabeth had the least doubt that the former
marriage had been legally dissolved. But when the
Duke left all his great fortune to Elizabeth, then his
nephews were furious, and raked up against her the
charge of bigamy, on the grounds that the sentence
of the Consistory Court was invalid. She was tried
in Westminster Hall before her peers in 1776, and
the trial lasted five days.</p>

<p>The penalty for bigamy was death, but she could
escape this sentence by claiming the benefit of a
statute of William and Mary, which commuted
death to branding in the hand and imprisonment.
The peers found her guilty, but she escaped punishment
by flying to the Continent, where she died
in 1788.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Harford Hall, where she resided, has about it no
architectural features; it never can have been other
than a small mansion, and is now a mere farmhouse.
The trees around it alone indicate that it was at one
time a gentleman's seat.</p>

<p>If now we strike across Stall Moor to the Yealm
we come on Yealm Steps, where the river falls over
a mass of granite débris. Here are two blowing-houses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
one above the steps and the other below.
The lower house on the eastern side of the stream
is a mere heap of ruins with, however, the door-jamb
standing and facing the north.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> No wheel-pit is
visible, but there are traces of a watercourse at a
high level to the north-east of the hut. Near the
entrance is a stone with one perfect mould in it, and
another imperfect. A second mould-stone is lying
near an angle in the eastern wall of the house. It
has in it two moulds adjoining each other&mdash;one at
a lower level than the other, and connected by a
channel. The high-level cavity is 15 inches long,
8 inches wide, and 3 inches deep. At one end is
a groove one inch deep, perpendicular, and running
down the side of the mould three inches; that is,
from top to bottom.</p>

<p>The low-level mould is 17 inches long, 12 inches
wide, and 5 inches deep. These cavities have been
used for the purification of tin, for the molten metal
mixed with furnace impurities poured in on the
high-level hollow would flow in a purer condition
into the low-level mould.</p>

<p>This blowing-house has been excavated, somewhat
superficially, but nothing was found in it to give
token of the period to which it belonged. About
a quarter of a mile further up the river, but on the
western bank, is another ruin. The doorway, which
is very imperfect, is on the eastern side. One mould-stone
remains, containing a mould 17 inches long,
12 inches wide, and from 4 to 5 inches deep.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>
<p>The whole slope of Stall Moor towards the south
is strewn with hut circles, and between the Yealm
and Broadall Lake is a pound containing several.
On the further side of the stream is another pound,
at which begins a singular wall that extends for over
three miles as far as the Plym at Trowlesworthy
Warren. For what purpose this wall was erected&mdash;whether
as a boundary, or whether for defence&mdash;cannot
be determined. It is in connection with
several pounds and clusters of hut circles.</p>

<p>In the valley of Hawns and Dendles is a pretty
cascade, a great haunt of the tripper, who ravages the
Yealm valley and tears up and carries off the ferns
and roots of wild flowers.</p>

<p>A few instances of the habits of the tripper may
not seem amiss, as exhibited in the Yealm valley.</p>

<p>Blachford was the residence of the late Lord
Blachford, the friend of Gladstone.</p>

<p>One day my lady saw a woman&mdash;a tripper&mdash;in
front of the house, where there is a rockery, tearing
up ferns. Lady Blachford rushed forth to interfere.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said the tripper, "I only did it so as to get
a sight of Lord Blachford. I thought if I executed
some mischief I might draw him forth."</p>

<p>A peculiarly fine rhododendron grew in front of the
vicarage. It attracted the tripper by its beautiful
masses of flower. One evening an individual of
this not uncommon species proceeded to tear it up,
assisted by trowel and knife; and finally having
hacked through the roots, carried it off; but finding
the load burdensome at the first hill, threw it away.</p>

<p>A gentleman residing further down the valley was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
cultivating a rare flowering shrub. After seven years
it put forth its tassels of bloom. He tarried a day
or two before gathering the blossoms till they were
fully out. His wife was an invalid, and he purposed
showing them to her when in their full perfection.
But before he carried his purpose into execution, he
went to Cornwood Station to meet a friend, when
he perceived a "lady" on the platform with her
hands full of the flowers. He approached her and
civilly inquired where she had obtained the beautiful
bunches.</p>

<p>"Oh! they were growing in Mr. P.'s ground, so
I went in and gathered them. I know Mr. P. well,
and I am convinced he would not object."</p>

<p>"You have the advantage of me, madam. I am
Mr. P. But to a lady, as to a Christian, all things
are lawful, though all things may not be expedient."</p>

<p>A friend threw open his grounds to a great party
of school teachers and their scholars. The neighbourhood
had been denuded of the <i lang="la">Osmunda regalis</i>
by the tripper, but the beautiful fern had a sanctuary
in his preserves. However, the visitors dug up, tore
away, and destroyed his plants wholesale, and returned
to town burdened with the wreckage. The
<em>Osmunda</em> is a slow grower, and takes many years
to reach maturity.</p>

<p>So much for the tripper. I do not in the least
suppose any of this race will see more of my book
than the outside. But I write this for the intelligent
visitor, to warn him against Hawns and Dendles
on Plymouth early closing day (Wednesday) in
summer.</p>

<p>Wisdome is the ancestral house of the Rogers
family, of which the late Lord Blachford was the representative.
It is a modest, picturesque old moorland
mansion of a small gentle family. Slade, on the
other hand, must have been a house of consequence;
it still possesses a noble hall, with richly carved
oak wainscotting. Steart has handsome carved
armorial gates; and Fardell is remarkable as a home
of the Raleigh family, and had its licensed chapel.
The grandfather of the navigator lived at Fardell,
and Sir Walter himself was probably there much
in his early days. Here was found an ogham
inscription on a stone, now in the British Museum,
which shows that the Irish had conquered and
colonised Devon as far south as Cornwood. Other
oghams have been found at Tavistock, and at
Lewannick, near Launceston.</p>

<p>According to local belief, the stone indicated
where treasure was hid; and a jingle was current
in the neighbourhood:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Between this stone and Fardell Hall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lies as much money as the devil can haul."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The stone bore the inscription, "Fanonii Macquisini"
on one side, and "Sapanni" on the other.
The "Mac" in the name is conclusively Irish, as
also the oghams.</p>

<p class="drop-capw"><span class="smcap">Yelverton</span> is a corruption of Elford-town.
The mansion near the station was formerly a
seat of the Elfords of Sheeps Tor. The family is
now extinct, at least in the neighbourhood where
at one time it was of dignity and well estated.
Yelverton is itself a mere collection of villa residences
of Plymouth men of business, but it forms
a convenient point of departure for many interesting
expeditions.</p>

<p>The principal residence of the Elfords was at
Longstone, in Sheeps Tor, where the old house
remains little altered, and where the <em>windstrew</em>
should be seen, a granite platform, raised above the
field, on which thrashing could be carried on by
the aid of the winds that carried away the chaff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>The tor which gives its name to the village and
parish stands by itself, and rises to about 1,200 feet.
It is a picturesque hill, and only needs the addition
of another couple of hundred put to its elevation
to make it perfect.</p>

<p>The basin below the village was anciently a lake,
the water being retained by a barrier of rock where
stands now the dam for the reservoir. This, in time,
was silted up to the depth of ninety feet, and now
the Plymouth Corporation, by the construction of a
fine and eminently picturesque barrier across the
narrow gorge through which the Meavy flows, have
reconverted this basin into a lake.</p>

<p>Near the summit of the tor is the Pixy Cave, in
which Squire Elford remained concealed whilst the
Roundheads searched Longstone for him. Some
faithful tenants in the village kept him supplied with
food till pursuit was at an end. The Elfords inherited
Longstone from the Scudamores at the close
of the fifteenth century. The parish was then called
Shettes Tor, from the Celtic <em>syth</em>, steep; but the
name has been altered in this or last century. The
last Elford of Sheeps Tor was John, who married
Admonition Prideaux, and died without issue in 1748,
his six children having predeceased him. A side
branch of the family&mdash;to which, however, Sheeps Tor
did not fall&mdash;produced Sir William Elford, Bart., of
Bickham, but he died in 1837, without male issue,
and the title became extinct. His monument is in
Totnes church.</p>

<p>A man named Cole, working at the granite quarries
at Merrivale Bridge, a few years ago sang me a song
concerning a doe that escaped from Elford Park, which
was probably situated where is now Yelverton.</p>

<p>I am a little puzzled as to whether the dry sarcasm
in this song is intentional.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> The melody is peculiarly
sweet and plaintive. <em>When</em> a royal duke hunted last
on Dartmoor I have been unable to ascertain.</p>

<p>The red deer were anciently common on Dartmoor.
It was not till King John's reign that Devon was
disafforested, with the exception of Dartmoor and
Exmoor. But the deer were mischievous to the
crops of the farmer, and to the young plantations,
and farmers, yeomen, and squires combined to get
rid of them from Dartmoor. Still, however, occasionally
one runs from Exmoor and takes refuge in
the woods about the Dart, the Plym, and the Tavy.</p>

<p>But it is for fox, hare, and otter hunting that the
sportsman goes to Dartmoor, and not for the deer.
A very pretty sight it is to see a pack with the
scarlet coats after it sweeping over the moorside in
pursuit of Reynard, and to hear the music of the
hounds and horns.</p>

<p>For the harriers the great week is that after hare-hunting
is at an end in the lowlands or "in-country."
Then the several packs that have hunted through the
season on the circumference of the moor unite on it,
and take turns through the week on the moor itself.
The great day of that week is Bellever Day, when
the meet is on the tor of that name. I have described
it in my <cite>Book of the West</cite>, and will not repeat
what has been already related. But I will venture to
quote an account of otter-hunting on the Dart from
the pen of Mr. William Collier, than whom no one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
has been more of an enthusiast for sport on the
moor.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The West Dart is the perfection of a Dartmoor river,
flowing bright and rapid over a bed of granite boulders
richly covered with moss and lichen, its banks bedecked
with ferns and wild flowers of the moor, and fringed with
the bog-myrtle and withy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p>"Water holds scent well, and the whiff so fragrant to the
nose of the hound rises to the surface and floats down
stream, calling forth his musical chant of praise. For this
reason otter-hunters draw up stream, and before the lair of
the otter is reached the welkin rings with the music of the
pack. The otter has left his trail on the banks, and on the
stones where he has landed when fishing, his spoor can be
seen freshly printed on a sandy nook, and he is very likely
to be found in a well-known and remarkably safe holt, as
they call it in the West, about half a mile above Dart Meet,
which he shares at times with foxes, though his access to it
is under water, and theirs, of course, above. If he were
but wise enough to stay there he might defy his legitimate
enemies to do their worst. But he knows not man or his
little ways, and he has heard the unwonted strain of the
hounds as they have been crying over his footsteps hard
by. They mark him in his retreat, and the whole pack
proclaim that he is in the otter's parlour, the strongest
place on the river. It is in a large rock hanging over a
deep, dark pool, in a corner made by a turn in the river,
with an old battered oak tree growing somehow from the
midst, and backed by a confused jumble of granite blocks.
The artist and the fisherman both admire this spot, though
for totally different reasons, but the hunter likes it not, for
he knows too well that if he runs the fox or the otter here
his sport is over. A fox or an otter if run here is likely to
stay; he has experienced the dangers and wickedness of
the world at large; but if found here in his quiet and
repose he takes alarm at the unusual turmoil, and incontinently
bolts. The otter is known to have a way in under
water, where no terrier can go, and he is so far safer than
the fox. The most arduous otter-hunters, therefore, when
the hounds mark, plunge up to their necks in the water to
frighten him out with their otter-poles. He has long known
the Dart as a quiet, peaceable, happy hunting-ground; and
he makes the fatal mistake of bolting, little recking what a
harrying awaits him for the next four hours. There immediately
arises a yell of 'Hoo-gaze!' the view halloo of
the otter-hunter, probably an older English hunting halloo
than 'Tally ho!' and the din of the hounds and terriers, the
human scream, and the horn, like Bedlam broken loose,
which he hears behind him, make him hurry up-stream as
best he may. The master of the hounds, if he knows his
business, will now call for silence, and, taking out his
watch, will give the otter what he calls a quarter of an
hour's law. It is wonderful how fond sportsmen are of
law; perhaps there is an affinity between prosecuting
a case and pursuing a chase. He wants the otter to go
well away from his parlour, and his object for the rest of
the day will be to keep him out of it. If he is a real
good sporting otter-hunter he will tell his field that he
wants his hounds to kill the otter without assistance from
them; for in the West of England the vice of mobbing
the otter is too common, with half the field in the water,
hooting, yelling, poking with otter-poles, mixing the wrong
scent (their own) with the right, making the water muddy,
and turning the river into a brawling brook with a vengeance.
The true otter-hunter only wants his huntsman
and whip, and perhaps a very knowing and trustworthy
friend, besides himself, to help in hunting the otter <em>with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
his hounds</em>, and not with men. The master gives the chase
a good quarter of an hour by the clock; and, leaving the
unearthly, or perhaps too earthly sounds behind him, the
otter makes up-stream as fast as he can go. It is surprising
how far an otter can get in the time, but fear lends speed
to his feet. Then begins the prettiest part of the sport.
The hounds are laid on, they dash into the river, and
instantly open in full cry. The water teems with the scent
of the otter; but the deep pools, rapid stickles, and rocky
boulders over which the river foams hinder the pace. There
is ample time to admire the spirit-stirring and beautiful
scene. The whole pack swimming a black-looking pool
under a beetling tor in full chorus; now and then an encouraging
note on the horn; the echoes of the deep valley;
the foaming and roaring Dart flowing down from above;
the rich colour from the fern, the gorse, the heather, the
moss, and the wild flowers; a few scattered weather-beaten
oaks and fir trees, and the stately tors aloft, striking on the
eye and ear, make one feel that otter-hunting on Dartmoor
is indeed a sport.</p>

<p>"The Dart is a large river, for a Dartmoor stream, and
presents many obstacles to the hounds; but they pursue
the chase for some distance, and at length stop and mark,
as they did before. The otter has got out of hearing, and
has rested in a lair known to him under the river-bank.
The terriers and an otter-pole dislodge him, and the sport
becomes fast and furious. He is seen in all directions,
sometimes apparently in two places at once, which makes
the novice think there are two or three otters afoot.
'Hoo-gaze!' is now often heard, as one or another
catches sight of him, and the field become very noisy
and excited. It is still the object to run him up-stream,
whilst he now finds it easier to swim down. 'Look out
below!' is therefore heard in the fine voice of the master.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
There is a trusty person down-stream watching a shallow
stickle, where the otter must be seen if he passes. Suddenly
the clamour ceases, and silence prevails. The otter
has mysteriously disappeared, and he has to be fresh found.
The master is in no hurry. There is too much scent in
the water of various sorts, and he will be glad to pause
till it has floated away. He takes his hounds down-stream.
The trusty man says the otter has not passed; but this
makes no difference. Some way further down, with a
wave of his hand, he sends all the hounds into the river
again with a dash. They draw up-stream again, pass the
trusty man still at his post, and reach the spot where the
otter vanished. The river is beautifully clear again, and
an old hound marks. A good hour, perhaps, has been lost,
or rather spent, since the otter disappeared, and here he
has been in one of his under-water dry beds. He is
routed out by otter-poles, and liveliness again prevails,
especially when he takes to the land to get down-stream
by cutting off a sharp curve in the river&mdash;a way he has
learnt in his frogging expeditions&mdash;and the hounds run him
then like a fox. He is only too glad to plunge headlong
into the river again, and he has reached it below the trusty
man, who, however, goes down to the next shallow, and
takes with him some others to turn the otter up from his
safe parlour. They are hunting him now in a long deep
pool, where he shifts from bank to bank, moving under
water whilst the hounds swim above. He has a large
supply of air in his lungs, which he vents as he uses it,
and which floats to the surface in a series of bubbles.
Otter-hunters calls it his chain, and it follows him wherever
he goes, betraying his track in the muddiest water. He
craftily puts his nose, his nose only, up to get a fresh
supply of air now and then, under a bush or behind a
rock, and then owners of sharp eyes call 'Hoo-gaze!' He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
finds himself in desperate straits, and he makes up his
mind to go for his parlour at all hazards; but the hounds
catch sight of him in the shallow of the trusty man, and
the chase comes to an end. Otters are never speared in
the West."<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p></div>

<p>And now to return to Sheeps Tor and the picturesque
village that nestles under it.</p>

<p>The one building-stone is granite, grey and soft
of tone. The village is small, and consists of a few
cottages about the open space before the church.</p>

<p>This latter is of the usual moorland type, and in
the Perpendicular style. Observe above the porch
the curious carved stone, formerly forming part of a
sun-dial, and dated 1640. It represents wheat growing
out of a skull, and bears the inscription&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"Mors janua vitæ."
</p>

<p>This church has most unfortunately been vulgarised
internally. It once possessed not only a magnificent
roodscreen, rich with gold and colour, but also a
fifteenth-century carved pulpit that matched with
the screen. The church was delivered over to a
Tavistock builder to make watertight, as cheaply
as might be, and he succeeded triumphantly in
transforming what was once a treasury of art into
a desolation. A few poor fragments of the screen
have been set up in the church by the vicar, with
an appeal to visitors to do something to obliterate
the infamy of its destruction by a restoration out
of what little remains. Most fortunately, working
drawings were taken of the screen before its destruction.
I give not only a drawing to scale of a bay as
it was, but also of a bay as it should be if restored, for
the vaulting had disappeared before its final ruin and
removal. Near the church stood formerly the old
vicarage, a mediæval dwelling, intact, with its oak,
nail-studded door and its panelled walls. This also
has been destroyed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 556px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>What of old times still remains is the bull-ring to
the south-east of the church. On the churchyard
wall sat the principal parishioners, as in a dress circle.
Near by is S. Leonard's Well, but it possesses no
architectural interest.</p>

<p>In Burra Tor Wood is a pretty waterfall. Burra Tor
was the residence of Rajah Brooke when in England.
It had been presented to him by the Baroness
Burdett Coutts and other admirers. In Sheeps Tor
churchyard he lies, but Burra Tor has been sold since
his death.</p>

<p>Above the wood stands Roman's Cross, probably
called after S. Rumon or Ruan, whose body lay at
Tavistock. There is another Rumon's Cross on Lee
Moor.</p>

<p>The drive from Douseland round Yennadon, above
the dam and the reservoir, to Sheeps Tor village,
is hardly to be surpassed for beauty anywhere on
the moor.</p>

<p>A walk that will richly repay the pedestrian is
one up the valley of the Narra Tor Brook, between
Sheeps Tor and Down Tor. He follows the Devonport
leat till he reaches the turn on the right to
Nosworthy Bridge. He passes Vinneylake, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
are two interesting <em>caches</em>, one cut out of the conglomerate
rubble brought down from the decomposed
rocks above. This is now used as a turnip-house, but
it is to be suspected it was anciently employed as a
private still-house. In a field hard by is another,
more like some of the Cornish structural fogous. It
is roofed over with slabs of granite.</p>

<p>The ascent of Deancombe presents many peeps of
great beauty. At the farm the road comes to an
end, and here the tor must be ascended. East of
Down Tor is a very fine stone row, starting from a
circle of stones inclosing a cairn, and extending in
the direction of a large, much-disturbed cairn. There
is a blocking-stone at the eastern end, and a menhir
by the ring of stones at the west end of the row.
The length is 1,175 feet.</p>

<p>I visited this row with the late Mr. Lukis in 1880,
when we found that men had been recently engaged
on the row with crowbars. They had thrown down
the two largest stones at the head. We appealed to
Sir Massey Lopes, and he stopped the destruction of
the monument, and since then Mr. R. Burnard and I
have re-erected the stones then thrown down.</p>

<p>On the slope of Coombshead Tor are numerous
hut circles and a pound.</p>

<p>From the stone row a walk along the ridge of the
moor leads to Nun's Cross. This bore on it the
inscription, "<span class="smcap">CRUX SIWARDI</span>." It is very rude; it
stands 7 feet 4 inches high, and is fixed in a socket
cut in a block of stone sunk in the ground. It was
overthrown and broken about 1846, but was restored
by the late Sir Ralph Lopes. By whom and for what
cause it was overthrown never transpired. The inscription
with the name of Siward is now difficult
to decipher. On the other side of the cross is
"<span class="smcap">BOC&mdash;LOND</span>"&mdash;three letters forming one line, and the
remaining four another, directly under it. The cross
is alluded to in a deed of 1240 as then standing.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p>Nun's Cross is probably a corruption of Nant
Cross, the cross at the head of the <em>nant</em> or valley.
The whole of Newleycombe Lake has been extensively
streamed. The hill to the north is dense with relics
of an ancient people. Roundy Farm, now in ruins,
takes its name from the pounds which contributed
to form the walls of its inclosures, many of which
follow the old circular erections that once inclosed
a primeval village. The ruined farmhouse bears the
initials of a Crymes, a family once as great as that of
the Elfords, but now gone. It is interesting to know
that the farmer's wife of Kingset, that now includes
Roundy Farm, was herself a Crymes. One very
perfect hut circle here was for long used as a potato
garden.</p>

<p>Hard by is Clakeywell Pool, by some called Crazy-well.
It is an old mine-work, now filled with water.
It covers nearly an acre, and the banks are in part
a hundred feet high. According to popular belief,
at certain times at night a loud voice is heard calling
from the water in articulate tones, naming the next
person who is to die in the parish. At other times
what are heard are howls as of a spirit in torment.
The sounds are doubtless caused by a swirl of wind
in the basin that contains the pond. An old lady,
now deceased, told me how that as a child she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
dreaded going near this tarn&mdash;she lived at Shaugh&mdash;fearing
lest she should hear the voice calling her by
name.</p>

<p>The idea of mysterious voices is a very old one.
The schoolboy will recall the words of Virgil in the
first <cite>Georgic</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"Vox ... per lucos vulgo exaudita silentes Ingens."
</p>

<p>The "wisht hounds" that sweep overhead in the
dark barking are brent-geese going north or returning
south. They have given occasion to many stories
of strange voices in the sky.</p>

<p>In Ceylon the devil-bird has been the source of
much superstitious terror.</p>

<p>A friend who has long lived in Ceylon says:
"Never shall I forget when first I heard it. I was
at dinner, when suddenly the wildest, most agonised
shrieks pierced my ear. I was under the impression
that a woman was being murdered outside my house.
I snatched up a cudgel and ran forth to her aid,
but saw no one." The natives regard this cry of
the mysterious devil-bird with the utmost fear.
They believe that to hear it is a sure presage of
death; and they are not wrong. When they have
heard it, they pine to death, killed by their own conviction
that life is impossible.</p>

<p>Autenrieth, professor and physician at Tübingen,
in 1822 published a treatise on <cite>Aërial Voices</cite>, in
which he collected a number of strange accounts of
mysterious sounds heard in the sky, and which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
thought could not all be deduced from the cries of
birds at night. He thus generalises the sounds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"They are heard sometimes flying in this direction, then
in the opposite through the air; mostly, they are heard as
though coming down out of the sky; but at other times as
if rising from the ground. They resemble occasionally
various musical instruments; occasionally also the clash of
arms, or the rattle of drums, or the blare of trumpets.
Sometimes they are like the tramp of horses, or the discharge
of distant artillery. But sometimes, also, they consist
in an indescribably hollow, thrilling, sudden scream.
Very commonly they resemble all kinds of animal tones,
mostly the barking of dogs. Quite as often they consist
in a loud call, so that the startled hearer believes himself
to be called by name, and to hear articulate words addressed
to him. In some instances, Greeks have believed
they were spoken to in the language of Hellas, whereas
Romans supposed they were addressed in Latin. The
modern Highlanders distinctly hear their vernacular Gaelic.
These aërial voices accordingly are so various that they
can be interpreted differently, according to the language
of the hearer, or his inner conception of what they might
say."</p></div>

<p>The Jews call the mysterious voice that falls from
the heaven Bathkol, and have many traditions relative
to it. The sound of arms and of drums and
artillery may safely be set down to the real vibrations
of arms, drums, and artillery at a great distance,
carried by the wind.</p>

<p>In the desert of Gobi, which divides the mountainous
snow-clad plateau of Thibet from the milder
regions of Asia, travellers assert that they have heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
sounds high up in the sky as of the clash of arms or
of musical martial instruments. If travellers fall to
the rear or get separated from the caravan, they hear
themselves called by name. If they go after the
voice that summons them, they lose themselves in
the desert. Sometimes they hear the tramp of
horses, and taking it for that of their caravan, are
drawn away, and wander from the right course and
become hopelessly lost. The old Venetian traveller
Marco Polo mentions these mysterious sounds, and
says that they are produced by the spirits that haunt
the desert. They are, however, otherwise explicable.
On a vast plain the ear loses the faculty of judging
direction and distance of sounds; it fails to possess,
so to speak, acoustic perspective. When a man has
dropped away from the caravan, his comrades call to
him; but he cannot distinguish the direction whence
their voices come, and he goes astray after them.</p>

<p>Rubruquis, whom Louis IX. sent in 1253 to the
court of Mongu-Khan, the Mongol chief, says that
in the Altai Mountains, that fringe the desert of Gobi,
demons try to lure travellers astray. As he was
riding among them one evening with his Mongol
guide, he was exhorted by the latter to pray, because
otherwise mishaps might occur through the demons
that haunted the mountains luring them out of the
right road.</p>

<p>Morier, the Persian traveller, at the beginning of
this century speaks of the salt desert near Khom.
On it, he says, travellers are led astray by the cry
of the goblin Ghul, who, when he has enticed them
from the road, rends them with his claws. Russian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
accounts of Kiev in the beginning of the nineteenth
century mention an island lying in a salt marsh between
the Caspian and the Aral Sea, where, in the
evening, loud sounds are heard like the baying of
hounds, and hideous cries as well; consequently the
island is reputed to be haunted, and no one ventures
near it.</p>

<p>That the Irish banshee may be traced to an owl
admits of little doubt; the description of the cries
so closely resembles what is familiar to those who
live in an owl-haunted district, as to make the
identification all but certain. Owls are capricious
birds. One can never calculate on them for hooting.
Weeks will elapse without their letting their notes
be heard, and then all at once for a night or two they
will be audible, and again become silent&mdash;even for
months.</p>

<p>The river Dart is said to cry. The sound is a
peculiarly weird one; it is heard only when the
wind is blowing down its deep valley, and is produced
by the compression of the air in the winding
passage. Whether it is calling for its annual
tribute of a human life, I do not know, but of the
river it is said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">

</div>

<p>To return to our walk.</p>

<p>If the path be taken leading back to Nosworthy
Bridge, beside and in the road will be seen several
mould-stones for tin.</p>

<p>Leather Tor is a fine pile of ruined granite. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
have been informed that great quantities of flints
have been found there, showing that at this spot
there was a manufacturing of silex weapons and
tools.</p>

<p>From Sheeps Tor the Drizzlecombe remains are
reached with great ease. Here, near a tributary
of the Plym, are three stone rows and two fine
menhirs, a kistvaen, a large tumulus, and beside
the stream a blowing-house with its mould-stones.
Two of the rows are single, but one is double for
a portion of its length only. There are blocking-stones
and menhirs to each. The row connected
with the great menhir is 260 feet long.</p>

<p>Sheeps Tor has been brought into the world by
the construction of the reservoir. Formerly it was
a place very much left to itself. There the old
fiddler hung on who played venerable tunes, to
which the people danced their old country dances.
These latter may still be seen there, but, alas! the
aged fiddler is dead. At one time it was a great
musical centre, and it was asserted that two-thirds
of the male population were in the church choir,
acting either as singers or as instrumentalists.</p>

<p>We will now turn our steps towards Meavy.</p>

<p>Here is a house that belonged to the Drake family,
half pulled down, a village cross under a very ancient
oak, and a church in good condition.</p>

<p>There is some very early rude carving at the
chancel arch in a pink stone, whence derived has
not been ascertained.</p>

<p>Marchant's Cross is at the foot of the steep ascent
to Ringmoor Down. It is the tallest of all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
moor crosses, being no less than 8 feet 2 inches
in height.</p>

<p>Another cross is in the hedge on Lynch Common.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 602px;">

<div class="caption"><p>CHANCEL CAPITAL, MEAVY.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Trowlesworthy Warren is situated among hut
circles and inclosures. There is a double stone
row on the southern slope, but it has been sadly
mutilated. The whole of the neighbouring moors are
strewn with primeval habitations.</p>

<p>On Lee Moor and Headon Down may be seen the
production of kaolin.</p>

<p>William Cookworthy, born at Kingsbridge in
Devon, in 1705, was one of a large family. His
father lost all his property in South Sea stock,
and died leaving his widow to rear the children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
as best she might. They were Quakers, and help
was forthcoming from the Friends. William kept
his eyes about him, and discovered the china-clay
which is found to so large an extent in Devon
and Cornwall, and he laid the foundation of the
kaolin trade between 1745 and 1750. One of the
first places where he identified the clay was on
Tregonning Hill in S. Breage parish, Cornwall,
and to his dying day he was unaware of the
enormous deposits on Lee Moor close to his Plymouth
home.</p>

<p>He took out a patent in 1768 for the manufacture
of Plymouth china, specimens of which are now
eagerly sought after.</p>

<p>Kaolin is dissolved feldspar, deposited from the
granite which has yielded to atmospheric and
aqueous influences.</p>

<p>The white clay is dug out of pits and then is
washed in tanks, in which the clayey sediment is
collected. This sediment has, however, first to be
purged of much of its mica and coarser particles
as the stream in which it is dissolved is conveyed
slowly over shallow "launders."</p>

<p>At the bottom of the pits are plugs, and so soon
as the settled kaolin is sufficiently thick, these plugs
are withdrawn, and the clay, now of the consistency
of treacle, is allowed to flow into tanks at a lower
level. Here it remains for three weeks or a month
to thicken, when it is transferred to the "dry," a
long shed with a well-ventilated roof, and with a furnace
at one end and flues connected with it that
traverse the whole "dry" and discharge into a chimney<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
at the further end of the building. On the floor of this
shed the clay rapidly dries, and it is then removed
in spadefuls and packed in barrels or bags, or merely
tossed into trucks for lading vessels. The clay is
now white as snow, and is employed either in the
Staffordshire potteries for the manufacture of porcelain,
or else for bleaching&mdash;that is to say, for
thickening calicoes, and for putting a surface on
paper. Some is employed in the manufacture of
alum; a good deal goes to Paris to be served up as
the white sugar of confectionery, and it is hinted that
not a little is employed in the adulteration of flour.
America, as well, imports it for the manufacture of
artificial teeth.</p>

<p>Great heaps of white refuse will be seen about the
china-clay works; these are composed of the granitic
sandy residuum. Of this there are several qualities,
and it is sold to plasterers and masons, and the
coarsest is gladly purchased for gravelling garden
walks. The water that flows from the clay works
is white as milk, and has a peculiar sweet taste.
Cows are said to drink it with avidity. The full
pans in drying present a metallic blue or green glaze
on the surface.</p>

<p>The kaolin sent to Staffordshire travels by boat
from Plymouth to Runcorn, where it is transhipped
on to barges on the Bridgewater Canal, and is so
conveyed to the belt of pottery towns, Burslem,
Hanley, Stoke, and Longton.</p>

<p>The Dewerstone towers up at the junction of the
Meavy and the Plym. On the side of the Plym
there are sheer precipices of granite standing up as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
church spires above the brawling river. The face
towards the Meavy is less abrupt, and it is on this
side that an ascent can be made, but it is a scramble.</p>

<p>On reaching the top, it will be seen that the
headland has been fortified by a double rampart
of stone thrown across the neck of land. Wigford
Down is in the rear, with kistvaens and tumuli and
hut circles on it.</p>

<p>The visitor should descend in the direction of
Goodameavy, and thence follow down the river that
abounds in beautiful scenes. It was formerly believed
that a wild hunter appeared on the summit of Dewerstone,
attended by his black dogs, blowing a horn.
From Dewerstone the visitor may walk to Bickleigh
Station, and take the train for Tavistock, which I have
written about in my <cite>Book of the West</cite>, and will not
re-describe in the present work.</p>

<p class="drop-capw"><span class="smcap">A colony</span> about a school-chapel and a few
deformed beech trees in a basin among tors
constitute Post Bridge.</p>

<p>Here the East Dart flows through a filled-up lake-bed,
and passes away by a narrow cleft that it has
sawn for itself through the granite.</p>

<p>The beech trees were planted at the same time
that two lodges were erected by a gentleman called
Hullett, who was induced to believe that he could
convert a portion of Dartmoor into paradise. He
purposed building a mansion at Stannon, and actually
began the house. But by the time the lodges were
set up and a wing of his house, he had discovered
that Dartmoor would spell ruin, and he threw up
his attempt. And Dartmoor will spell ruin unless
approached and treated in the only suitable manner.
It will pasture cattle and feed ponies and sheep, but
it will never grow corn and roots.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p>The great central causeway crossed the modern road
near the Dissenting chapel, and may be traced in the
marsh aiming for the river, beyond which it ascends
the hill and strikes along the brow behind Archerton.
It is paved, and is a continuation of the old Fosse
Way. It is certainly not Roman work, but British.</p>

<p>Post Bridge has been termed, not accurately, a
prehistoric metropolis of the moor. This is because
round the ancient lake-bed were numerous pounds
containing hut circles. Most of these have now been
destroyed, yet one remains perfect&mdash;Broadun; and
adjoining it is Broadun Ring, where the outer circle
of the inclosure has been pulled down, but a considerable
number of the huts has been spared.
There remain indications of fifteen of these inclosures.
More have certainly been destroyed.</p>

<p>Lake-head Hill has been almost denuded of the
monuments that once crowded it. They were
systematically removed by the farmer at Bellever.
Happily one kistvaen has been left on the summit,
and there are two or three others, small and ruinous,
on the sides.</p>

<p>The "cyclopean bridge" over the Dart is composed
of rude masses of granite maintained in
position by their own weight. It was the old pack-horse
bridge.</p>

<p>There are other bridges of the same description;
one is on the stream at Bellever, one under Bairdown.
But a structure of this sort is the simplest and most
easily reared on Dartmoor, where lime is not found,
and has to be brought at great expense from a
distance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p>Great numbers of worked flints are found in this
neighbourhood, and a bronze ferrule to a spear was
dug up a few years ago in Gawlor Bottom.</p>

<p>A little way, but a few steps below the bridge, on
the west side, is a comparatively modern blowing-house;
two mould-stones for tin may be seen there
lying among the nettles. This house is built with
mortar and is of considerable size, whereas the
ancient blowing-houses are very small, and no lime
has been employed in their construction. One of
these with a <em>cache</em> may be found in the midst of the
tinners' heaps if the Dart be followed up to where it
makes a sudden bend and comes from the east.
Here a tongue of hill stands out above it, and a
stream sweeps down from the north to join it. A
very short distance up this stream is the blowing-house
with a beehive <em>cache</em>.</p>

<p>If this stream be pursued, and Sittaford Tor be
aimed at, then a few hundred yards to the right of
the tor the Grey Wethers will be found, two very fine
circles in contact with one another; but the stones of
one are nearly all down.</p>

<p>If the Ordnance Sheet XCIX., N.W., be taken,
and the ridge followed north-west along the line
indicated by bench-marks, Cut Hill will finally be
attained, which is all bog, but which has a gash cut
in it to afford a passage through the moors from
Okehampton to Post Bridge. This expedition will
take the visitor into some of the wildest and most
desolate portions of the northern half of Dartmoor.</p>

<p>Many years ago the question was mooted in, I
think, the <cite>Times</cite>, whether there were really such
things as Jack-o'-lanterns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>Few instances can be recorded where this <i lang="la">ignis
fatuus</i> has been seen on Dartmoor, probably because
so few cattle are lost in the bogs there. I was told
by a man accustomed to draw turf, that he has seen
the legs and belly of the horse as though on fire,
where it had been splashed by the peat water.</p>

<p>I walked one night from Plymouth to Tavistock
across Roborough Down, before it was inclosed and
built upon, and I then saw a little blue flame dancing
on a pool. I went on my knees and crept close to it,
to make quite sure what it was, and that it was not
a glow-worm.</p>

<p>Mr. Coaker, of Sherberton, informs me that he has
on several occasions seen the Jack-o'-lantern. There
is a bit of marshy land where rises Muddy Lake,
near the road from Princetown to Ashburton, and
he has seen it there. Sometimes, according to his
account, it appears like the flash of a lantern, and
then disappears, and presently flashes again. It has
also been seen by him in the boggy ground of Slade
by Huccaby Bridge. There, on one occasion, he
made his way towards it. From a distance the light
seemed to be considerable, but as he approached it
appeared only as a small flame.</p>

<p>The Rev. T. E. Fox, curate, living at Post Bridge,
and serving the little chapel there and that at
Huccaby, has also seen it, in Brimpts, hovering, a
greenish-blue flame, about three feet above the soil;
and a woman living near informs me that she also
has noticed it in the same place.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>The reader must excuse me if I tell the tales just
as told to me, and mix up facts with what I consider
fictions. I cannot doubt that these lights have been
seen by others as well as by myself, and I am not
surprised if here and there some superstition has
attached itself to these phenomena.</p>

<p>The following story is told in the parish of Broad-woodwidger,
where is a field in which, it is asserted,
Will-o'-the-wisp is seen.</p>

<p>The farmer's son was delicate, and in haymaking
time assisted in the work, and I have no doubt,
notwithstanding his feeble lungs, in making sweet
hay with the maidens. However, he over-exerted
himself, broke a blood-vessel, and died. Ever since
a blue flame has been seen dancing in this field, and
even on the top of the haycocks.</p>

<p>The tale I have heard told, as a child, of a blue
flame being seen leaving the churchyard and travelling
down the lanes or roads to a certain door, and
there waiting and returning accompanied by another
flame, which appeared simultaneously with a death
occurring in the house, is doubtless a distortion of a
fact that such a flame as the Jack-o'-lantern <em>does</em>
occasionally appear in graveyards.</p>

<p>A miner engaged at the Whiteworks crossed the
moor on a Saturday to Cornwood, to see a brother
who was dangerously ill, and started to return somewhat
late on the Sunday afternoon. In consequence,
night overtook him on the moor; he became
entangled among the bogs, and was in sore distress,
unable to proceed or to retreat.</p>

<p>Being an eminently God-fearing man, he took off
his cap and prayed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>All at once a little light sprang up and moved
forward. He knew that this was a Will-o'-the-wisp,
and that it was held to lead into dangerous
places; but his confidence in Providence was so
strong, and so assured was he that the light was
sent in answer to his prayer, that he followed it.
He was conducted over ground fairly firm, though
miry, till he reached heather and a sound footing,
whereupon the flame vanished. Thanking God, he
pursued his way, taking his direction by the stars,
and reached his destination in safety.</p>

<p>"I tell the tale as 'twas told to me," but I will not
vouch for the truth of it, as I did not hear it from
the man himself, nor did I know him personally, so
as to judge whether his word could be trusted.</p>

<p>Here, however, is an instance on which implicit
reliance can be placed.</p>

<p>Mr. W. Bennett Dawe, of Hill, near Ashburton,
together with his family, saw one on several nights
in succession in the autumn of 1898. The month
of September had been very hot and dry, and this
was succeeded by a heavy rainfall in October during
twenty-three days. The mean temperature of the
month was 54·7, being 4° above the average of
twenty years. The warm damp season following
on the heated ground and the boggy deposits in the
Dart valley resulted in the generation of a good
deal of decomposition. Mr. Dawe and several of his
household observed at night a light of a phosphorescent
nature in the meadows between Ashburton
and Pridhamsleigh. It appeared to hover a little
above the ground and dance to and fro, then race<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
off in another direction, as if affected by currents
of air. This was watched during several evenings,
and the members of his family were wont as darkness
fell to go out and observe it. The meadows are
on deep alluvial soil, formerly marsh, and were
drained perhaps sixty years ago.</p>

<p>The same gentleman saw a similar flame in the
form of a ball some forty years previously in the
low and then marshy valley between Tor Abbey
gateway and the Paignton road, near where is now
the Devon Rosery. The valley was then undrained.
The gas generated, which catches fire on rising
to the surface, is phosphoretted hydrogen, and is
certainly evolved by decay of animal matter in
water; if occasionally seen in churchyards it is
probably after continued rain, when the graves have
become sodden.</p>

<p>Jack-o'-lantern is called in Yorkshire Peggy-wi'-t'-wisp;
consequently the treacherous, misleading
character is there attributed to a sprite of that
sex which has misled man from the first moment
she appeared on earth&mdash;who never rested till she
had led him out of the terrestrial paradise into
one of her own making.</p>

<p>I was talking about this one evening in a little
tavern, over the fire, to a Cornishman, when he laughed
and volunteered a song. It was one, he said, that was
employed as a test to see whether a man were sober
enough to be able to repeat the numbers correctly
that followed at the close of each stanza.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>An industry on Dartmoor that has become completely
extinct is the collection of lichen from the
rocks for the use of the dyers. There exists in MS.
an interesting book by a Dr. Tripe, of Ashburton,
recording what he saw and did each day, at the close
of last century. He says that he observed women
scraping off the lichen from the rocks near the Drewsteignton
cromlech. This they sold to the dyers, who
dried it, reduced it to powder, and treated it with a solution
of tin in <i lang="la">aqua fortis</i> and another ingredient, when
a most vivid scarlet dye was produced. The lichen is
called botanically <i lang="la">Lichinoides saxatile</i>. Other lichens
were employed to give purple and yellow colours.
The cudbear and crab's-eye lichens (<i lang="la">Lecanora tartarea</i>
and <i lang="la">Lecanora parella</i>) gave a dye of a royal purple,
and the two species called <i lang="la">Parmelia saxatilis</i> and
<i lang="la">Parmelia omphalodes</i> gave a yellowish brown. Moss
also was employed for the purpose; the <i lang="la">Hypnum
cupressiforme</i> yielded a rich reddish brown.</p>

<p>"Lichens and mosses," says Mr. Parfitt, "are the
pioneers of the vegetable kingdom in attacking the
hard and almost impenetrable rocks, and so preparing
the way for the more noble plants&mdash;the trees
and shrubs&mdash;by gradual disintegration, and by adding
their own dead bodies to the soil, enrich it for the
food of others."<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>It is marvellous to see how the lichen attaches
itself to the granite. A harshly glaring piece that
the quarrymen have cut is touched with fine specks
that spread into black and crocus-yellow circles, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
tone down the stone to a sober tint. Unhappily of
late years there has been much firing of the furze
and heather on the moor, and the flames destroy the
beautiful lichens and mosses, and leave the old stones
white and ghostly, not to be reclothed with the old
tints for centuries.</p>

<p>I do not think that we have any idea of the slowness
with which the lichens spread; a century to
them is nothing&mdash;it passes as a watch in the night.
There is a granite post I often go by. It was set
up just seventy years ago, and on it the largest
golden circle of the <i lang="la">Physcia parietina</i> has attained
the diameter of an inch. Mr. Parfitt mentions in
connection with it a rocky crag at Baggy Point,
North Devon, where it covers the whole surface with
a coat of golden colour. It spreads more rapidly
on slate than it does on granite, and especially on
such slates as are liable to rapid disintegration. The
Woodland and the Coryton slates are readily attacked
by it. The growth begins with a splash about the
size of a sixpence, and increases to that of a plate,
when the centre breaks up, and the ring becomes
detached in fragments which meet others, and so
appear to cover the rock or roof.</p>

<p>One of the most beautiful of the lichens on the
moor is the coral moss, <i lang="la">Sphærophoron coralloides</i>. It
is a pale greenish-white, upright-growing lichen, that
forms a cup, and somewhat resembles an old Venetian
wineglass. Then points of brilliant scarlet form
round the lip of the cup, and increase in size till
the whole presents a wonderful appearance as of
sealing-wax splashed over the soil. It is not con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>fined
to the moorland, but grows also in woods,
where there has been a clearance made. I came
upon a wonderful carpet of sprinkled scarlet and
white on one occasion, where there was a woodman's
track through an old oak coppice. But it must be
capricious, for of late years when searching for it in
the same spot I have found no more. The black
coral moss is scarce, but it has been found about
Lynx and Yes Tors.</p>

<p>The birds on Dartmoor have a hard time of it, not
only because of the guns levelled at them, but because
of the "swaling" or burning of the moor, which takes
place at the time when they are nesting. In East
Anglia there are along the coast the "bird tides,"
as the people say. At that period when the plovers
and sea-mews are nesting in the marshes, there are unusually
low tides, a provision of God, so it is held, for
the protection of the feathered creatures whilst laying
and hatching out their eggs. So the ancients told of
the halcyon days when the gods had pity on the seabirds,
and smoothed seven to eleven days in the winter
solstice, that they might with safety hatch their young.
But on Dartmoor man has none of this pity; he
selects the very time when the poor birds are sitting
in their nests on their eggs, or are cherishing their
callow young, for enveloping them in flames. The
buzzard, the hen-harrier, and the sparrow-hawk are
now chiefly seen in the most lonely portions of the
moor. Gulls visit it on the approach of stormy
weather; but the ring-ouzel is there throughout the
year. The golden and grey plovers are abundant;
the pipe of the curlew may be heard; black grouse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
and quail may be shot, as also snipe. By the water,
that living jewel the kingfisher can be observed
watching for his prey, and about every farm the blue
tit, called locally the hicky maul or hicka noddy, is
abundant. The sand martin breeds in a few places.
The heron has a place where she builds at Archerton.</p>

<p>The snow bunting and cirl bunting are met with
occasionally.</p>

<p>The cuckoo is heard on the moor before he visits
the lowlands. "March, he sits on his perch; April,
he tunes his bill; May, he sings all day; June, he
alters his tune, and July, away he do fly." So say
the people.</p>

<p>One of the freshest and most delicious of Devonshire
folk-melodies is that connected with a song
about the cuckoo.</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">She sucketh sweet flowers<br /></span>

<p>There is a saying among the country folk:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Kill a robin or a wren,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never prosper, boy or man."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The wren is said to be the king of all birds. The
story told to account for this is that the birds once
assembled to elect a sovereign, and agreed that that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
one of the feathered creation who soared highest
should be esteemed king. The eagle mounted, and
towered aloft high above the rest, but was outwitted
by the wren, who, unobserved and unfelt, had hopped
on to the eagle's back.</p>

<p>The birds were so distressed and angry at the
trick that they resolved to drown the wren in their
tears. Accordingly they procured a pan into which
each bird in turn wept. When it was nearly full the
blundering old owl came up. "With such big eyes,"
said the birds, "he will weep great tears." But he
perched on the edge of the pan and upset it.
Thenceforth the wren has reigned undisputed king
of the birds.</p>

<p>There is a curious story told of a wren. In one
of the Irish rebellions a party of British military
were out after the enemy when, having made a long
march, they lay down to sleep and left no one to
keep sentinel. As they lay slumbering the murderous
rascals stole up, creeping like snakes in the grass
and among the bushes, and would have butchered
the entire party had it not been for a wren, which,
perching on the drum belonging to the company,
tapped it repeatedly with its little beak. This roused
the soldiers, they became aware of their situation,
and were able just in time to fire on their assailants
and disperse them.</p>

<p>In Ireland, and in Pembrokeshire and elsewhere in
South Wales, it was usual, on S. Stephen's Day or
at the New Year, to put a wren in a lantern that
was decorated with ribbons and carry it about to
farms and cottages, with a song, which was repaid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
by a small coin. Whether such a custom existed
in Devon I cannot say; I remember nothing of
the sort.</p>

<p>The sparrow-hawk is often seen quivering aloft in
the air. A curious story is told of one by Mr. Elliot.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"As is well known, not only sparrow-hawks, but other
birds of prey as well as other species, repair to the same
site year after year for nesting. This knowledge is valuable
to the keepers, who look up these haunts and try to shoot
the old birds before they hatch their eggs. On one
occasion he shot the female as she came off the nest, and
this satisfied him, but on visiting the spot later he was
surprised at another female flying off; on climbing to the
nest he found that the male must have found another mate,
as they had built a second nest over and into the old one,
which contained four eggs, whilst the freshly-built nest
contained five."<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p></div>

<p>One has supposed hitherto that the gay widower
who looked out for another spouse after having lost
the first was a product of the human species only.</p>

<p>A visitor to Dartmoor in June or July will be
surprised to find flights of rooks over it. As soon
as their maternal cares are over, they desert the
rookeries on the lowland and go for change of air
and diet to the moor, where they feed on the
whortleberry, possibly, but most certainly on the
daddy longlegs and its first cousin, who is the hateful
wireworm in his fully developed form. A friend
one day saw a bit of the moor dense with rooks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
and surprised at their movements and excitement,
observed them closely, and discovered that they were
having a glut of daddy longlegs. The light and
friable peat earth exactly suits the wireworm in its
early stages, and when the pest emerged from the
soil full blown, then the rooks were down on him
before he could come to our gardens and turnip
fields to devastate them.</p>

<p>The one deficiency in the soil on Dartmoor is
lime. That will sweeten the grass and enable the
cattle to thrive. Bullocks and other cattle will do
on the moor, but they really need a change to land
on lime whilst they are growing. The roots of the
grass and heather are ravenous after lime, and for
this reason it is that of the many interments on the
moor hardly a particle of bone remains.</p>

<p>From Post Bridge starts the Lych Way, the Road
of the Dead, along which corpses were conveyed to
Lydford, the parish church, until, in 1260, Bishop
Bronescombe gave licence to the inhabitants of
Dartmoor, who lived nearer to Widdecombe than
to Lydford, to resort thither for baptisms and
funerals.</p>

<p>The Lych Way may be traced from Conies Down
Tor to Whitabarrow; thence it strikes for Hill Bridge,
and so across the spur of Black Down to Lydford
church.</p>

<p>When I was a boy I heard strange tales of the
Lych Way&mdash;and of funerals being seen passing over
it of moonlight nights. But superstition is dead
now on Dartmoor, as elsewhere, and ghosts as well as
pixies have been banished, not as the old moormen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
say, by the "ding-dongs" of the church and mission
chapel bells, but by the voice of the schoolmaster.</p>

<p>A walk or scramble down the Dart will take to
the ruins of the Snaily House, the story concerning
which I have told elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> It may be carried
on to Dartmeet, where a little colony of inhabitants
will be found, and a return may be taken over Bellever
Tor, a striking height that holds its own,
and seems to be the true centre of the moor. On
its slopes are several kistvaens, but all have been
robbed of their covering-stones. There is an unpleasant
morass between Bellever Tor and the high-road.</p>

<p>I was witness here of a rather amusing scene. A
gentleman with his wife and a young lady friend of
hers had driven out, from Princetown or Tavistock,
and when near Bellever the latter expressed a wish
to go to the summit of the tor. The gentleman
looked at his better half, who gave consent with a
nod, whereupon he started with the young lady, and
his wife drove on and put up the horse at Post Bridge,
then walked back to meet the two as they returned
to the high-road, on which madame promenaded.
Now, as it fell out, the husband missed his way on
trying to reach the high-road, and got to the morass,
where he and the young lady walked up and down,
and every now and then he extended his hand and
helped her along from one tuft of grass to another.
They went up&mdash;got more involved&mdash;then down
again, and were fully half an hour in the morass.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>
<p>Madame paced up and down the road, glaring at
her husband and the young lady dallying on the
moor, as she took it; for she was quite unable to
apprehend the reason why they did not come to
her as the crow flies, and as she considered was
her due. Her pace was accelerated, her turns
sharper, her glances more indignant, as minute after
minute passed. She saw them approach, then turn
and retrace their steps, gyrate, holding each other's
hands, and walk down the slope some way. Then
along the road, snorting like a war-horse, went the
lady. She flourished her parasol at them; she
called, they paid no attention. Finally they headed
the swamp and arrived on the firm road. Thereupon
the lady strode forward speechless with wrath
towards Post Bridge and the inn, where a high tea
was ready. Not a word would she vouchsafe to
either. Not a word of explanation would she listen
to from her husband.</p>

<p>Curious to see the end, I went on to Webb's Inn,
and came in on the party.</p>

<p>The gentleman sat limp and crestfallen.</p>

<p>An excellent tea was ready. Cold chicken, ham,
whortleberry jam and Devonshire cream. He ate
nothing.</p>

<p>"My dear," said madame to her husband, "you are
not eating."</p>

<p>"No, precious!" he replied. "I have lost my
appetite."</p>

<p>"But," retorted she, "the moor gives one."</p>

<p>"Not to me," he responded feebly. "I don't feel
well. The moor has taken mine away."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>Obviously there had been an interview, <em>tête-à-tête</em>,
before they sat down.</p>

<p>Presently I saw them drive away.</p>

<p>Madame brandished the whip and held the reins,
and the young lady friend sat in front.</p>

<p>Monsieur was behind, disconsolate and sniffing.</p>

<p class="drop-capw"><span class="smcap">King Louis XIV.</span> selected the most barren
and intractable bit of land out of which to
create Versailles, with its gardens, plantations, and
palace; and Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt chose the most
inhospitable site for the planting of a town. Sir
Thomas was Black Rod, and Warden of the Stannaries.
He was a man of a sanguine temperament,
for he calculated on reaping gold where he sowed
shillings, and that in Dartmoor bogs.</p>

<p>At his recommendation prisons were erected at
Princetown in 1806, at a cost of £130,000, for the
captives in the French and American wars. Sir
George Magrath, <span class="smcap">M.D.</span>, the physician who presided
over the medical department from 1814 until the
close of the war, testified to the salubrity of the
establishment.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"From personal correspondence with other establishments
similar to Dartmoor, I presume the statistical record
of that great tomb of the living (embosomed as it is in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
a desert and desolate waste of wild, and in the winter
time terrible scenery, exhibiting the sublimity and grandeur
occasionally of elemental strife, but never partaking of
the beautiful of Nature; its climate, too, cheerless and
hyperborean), with all its disadvantages, will show that the
health of its incarcerated tenants, in a general way, equalled,
if not surpassed, any war prison in England or Scotland.
This might be considered an anomaly in sanitary history,
when we reflect how un-genially it might be supposed to
act on southern constitutions; for it was not unusual in
the months of December and January for the thermometer
to stand at thirty-three to thirty-five degrees below freezing,
indicating cold almost too intense to support animal life.
But the density of the congregated numbers in the prison
created an artificial climate, which counteracted the torpifying
effect of the Russian climate without. Like most
climates of extreme heat or cold, the newcomers required
a seasoning to assimilate their constitution to its
peculiarities, in the progress of which indispositions,
incidental to low temperature, assailed them; and it
was an everyday occurrence among the reprobate and
incorrigible classes of the prisoners, who gambled away
their clothing and rations, for individuals to be brought
up to the receiving room in a state of suspended animation,
from which they were usually resuscitated by the process
resorted to in like circumstances in frigid regions. I
believe one death only took place during my sojourn at
Dartmoor, from torpor induced by cold, and the profligate
part of the French were the only sufferers. As soon as
the system became acclimated to the region in which they
lived, health was seldom disturbed."</p></div>

<p>There were from seven to nine thousand prisoners
incarcerated in the old portion of the establishment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
They were packed for the night in stages one above
another, and we can well believe that by this means
they "created an artificial climate," but it must have
been an unsavoury as well as an unwholesome one.</p>

<p>Over the prison gates is the inscription "<i lang="la">Parcere
subjectis</i>," and the discomfort of so many being
crammed into insufficient quarters strikes us now,
and renders the inscription ironical; but it was not so
regarded or intended at the time. Our convicts are
nursed in the lap of luxury as compared with the condition
of the prisoners at the beginning of the century.
But then the criminal is the spoiled child of the age,
to be petted, and pampered, and excused.</p>

<p>A convict with one eye, his nose smashed on one
side, with coarse fleshy lips, was accosted by the
chaplain. "For what are you in here, my man?"
"For bigamy," was the reply. "'Twasn't my fault;
the women would have me."</p>

<p>One marvels that such a deformed, plain spot as
the <em>col</em> between the two Hessary Tors should have
been selected for a town. The only reply one can
give is that Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt and the Prince
Regent would have it so. It is on the most inclement
site that could have been selected, catching
the clouds from the south-west, and condensing fog
about it when everywhere else is clear. It is exposed
equally to the north and east winds. It stands over
fourteen hundred feet above the sea, above the sources
of the Meavy, in the ugliest as well as least suitable
situation that could have been selected; the site determined
by Sir Thomas, so as to be near his granite
quarries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p>There have been various attempts made by prisoners
to escape. One of the most desperate was in November,
1880, when a conspiracy had been organised
among the convicts. At the time a good many
were engaged in a granite quarry. They had agreed
to make a sudden dash on the warders, overpower
them, whilst in the quarry; and they chose for the
attempt the day in the month on which the governor
went to Plymouth to receive the money for payment
of the officials, with intent to waylay, rob, and murder
him, then to break up into parties of two, and disperse
over the moor.</p>

<p>One of the conspirators betrayed them, so that the
scheme was known. It was deemed advisable not
in any way to alter the usual arrangements, lest this
should inspire suspicion in the minds of the convicts.
The warders, armed with rifles, who keep guard at
a distance round the quarry, were told when they
heard the chief warder's whistle to close round the
quarry, and, if necessary, fire.</p>

<p>The gang was marched, as usual, under a slender
escort, to the quarry, and work was begun as usual.
All went well till suddenly the ringleader turned
about and, with his crowbar, struck at the head
warder and staggered him for the moment: he reeled
and almost fell. Instantly the convict shouted to
his fellows, "Follow me, boys! Hurrah for freedom!"
And they made a dash for the entrance to the quarry.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the head warder had rallied sufficiently
to whistle, but before the outer ring of guards appeared
some of the under warders discharged their
rifles at the two leading convicts. One fell dead, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
other was riddled with shot, yet, strange to say, lived,
and, I believe, is alive still.</p>

<p>Before the rest of the conspirators could master
the warders in the quarry and get away, the men
who had been summoned appeared on the edge of
the hollow, that was like a crater, with their rifles
aimed at the convicts, who saw the game was up,
and submitted.</p>

<p>There are always some crooked minds and perverse
spirits in England ready to side with the
enemies of their country or of society, whether Boers
or burglars; and so it was in this case. A great
outcry was made at the shooting of the two ringleaders.
If a warder had been killed, no pity would
have been felt for him by these faddists. All their
feelings of sympathy were enlisted on behalf of the
wrongdoer.</p>

<p>A curious case occurred in 1895.</p>

<p>On March 10th, Sunday, at night, the chaplain,
who lived in a house in the town, being unable to
sleep, about half-past eleven went downstairs in his
dressing-gown. He was surprised to notice a light
approaching from the study. Then he observed a
man emerge into the hall, holding a large clasp
knife in his hand. On seeing the chaplain, whose
name was Rickards, he uttered a yell, and rushed
at him with the knife.</p>

<p>The chaplain, who maintained his nerve, said,
"Stop this fooling, and come in here and let us have
a little talk; you have clearly lost your way."</p>

<p>The fellow offered no resistance, and allowed himself
to be led into the study, where the Rev. C.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
Rickards quietly seated himself on the table, and
said to the burglar, "Now, we shall get on better
if you give me up that knife." At the same time
he took hold of the blade and attempted to gain
possession of it. He had disengaged two of the
man's fingers from it, when the fellow drew the knife
away, thereby badly cutting the chaplain's hand.
Mr. Rickards then jumped off the table, exclaiming,
"This is not fair!"</p>

<p>"Look here," said the burglar, "I won't be took
at no price," and flourished the knife defiantly.
Noticing that the fellow's pockets bulged greatly,
Mr. Rickards said, "You're not going out with my
property," and closed with him, and endeavoured
to put his hand into one of the pockets. The
burglar resisted, and made for the door. Mr.
Rickards now got near where his gun hung on the
wall; he took it down, and clicked the hammer.
The gun was not loaded. The burglar then blew
out the candle he carried, and ran from the room.
Mr. Rickards at once loaded his gun with cartridges,
and followed the fellow into the passage. He still
had his own candle alight. The man then bolted
into the drawing-room, and endeavoured to open
the window. The chaplain entered, and said, "Now
bail up; up with your arms, or I shall fire."</p>

<p>Thereupon the burglar made a dash at him, head
down, and the chaplain retreated, the man rushing
after him. Mr. Rickards had no desire to fire, and
as the fellow plunged past him, he struck at him
with the gun, but missed him. The fellow then
dashed through the doorway, and ran again into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
study. The chaplain pursued him, and, standing in
the doorway, said, "Now I have you. The gun is
loaded, and I shall certainly fire if you come towards
me."</p>

<p>The burglar stood for a moment eyeing him, and
then made a leap at him with the uplifted knife;
and Mr. Rickards fired at his legs. The man was
hit, and staggered back against the mantel-board.
The chaplain said, "Have you had enough?"</p>

<p>Again the fellow gathered himself up with raised
knife to fall on him, when Mr. Rickards said coolly,
"The other barrel is loaded, and I shall fire if you
advance." The man, however, again came on, when
the chaplain fired again, and hit the man in his
right arm, and the knife fell. Mr. Rickards stooped,
picked up the knife, closed it, and put it into his
pocket. Then, thinking that there might be more
than this one man engaged in the burglary, he reloaded
his gun. The burglar now went down in a
lump on the hearthrug, bleeding badly.</p>

<p>By this time the house was roused; the servants
had taken alarm, and had sent for the warders, who
arrived, and a doctor was summoned.</p>

<p>The fellow had been engaged in a good many
robberies prior to this.</p>

<p>One night a couple of young convicts escaped,
and obtained entrance into the doctor's house, where
evidently a large supper party had been held, as the
tables had not been cleared after the departure of
the guests. Afterwards, when retaken, one of the
men said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir, it was just as though the doctor had made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
ready, and was expecting us to supper. The table
was laid, and there were chickens and ham, tongue,
and cold meats, with puddings, cakes, and decanters
of wine, making our mouths fairly water. We ate
and ate as only two hungry convicts could eat after
the semi-starvation of prison diet. I could not look
at a bit more when I had finished. 'Try just a leetle
slice more of this ham,' said my chum. 'No, thank
you, Bill; I couldn't eat another mouthful to save my
life.' And so we left, and were caught on going out."</p>

<p>Soon after this the chaplain visited the fellow who
had been recaptured, and seeing him depressed and
in a very unhappy frame of mind, said to him, "Anything
on your soul, man? Your conscience troubling
you?"</p>

<p>"Terrible," answered the convict; "I shall never
get over my self-reproach&mdash;not taking another slice
of ham."</p>

<p>An old man succeeded in getting away in a fog;
he ran as far as Ilsington before he was caught.</p>

<p>When brought back he was rather oddly attired,
and amongst other things carried a labourer's hoe.
This he employed vigorously when crossing fields,
if anyone came in sight. When captured a farmer
came to view him. "Why, drat it," he exclaimed,
"that's the man I saw hoeing Farmer Coaker's stubble
fields the other day. It struck me as something new
in farming, and I was going to ask him what there
was in it that he paid a labourer to hoe his stubbles."
This same convict, who was acquainted with the
neighbourhood, whilst temporarily at large paid a
visit to his wife one night. He asked her to let him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
come into the house, telling who he was. "Not
likely; you don't come in here. The policeman's
about the place, and I don't want 'ee," was her
cheering reply.</p>

<p>During another recent escape from Dartmoor an
amusing incident occurred in a lonely lane on a dark
night in the neighbourhood of Walkhampton. Two
warders on guard mistook an inoffensive but partially
inebriated farmer for the escaped convict, and
he mistook them for a couple of runaways.</p>

<p>"Here he comes," exclaimed one warder to the
other at the sound of approaching footsteps. "Now
for him," as they both pounced out of the hedge
where they had been in hiding, and seized hold of
the man.</p>

<p>"Look here, my good fellows," he cried. "I know
who you be. You be them two runaways from
Princetown, and I'll give you all I've got, clothes
and all, if only you won't murder me. I've got a
wife and childer to home. I'm sure now I don't
a bit mind goin' home wi'out any of my clothes
on to my body. My wife'll forgive that, under the
sarcumstances; but to go back wi'out nother my
clothes nor my body either&mdash;that would be more
nor my missus could bear and forgive. I'd niver
hear the end of it."</p>

<p>Formerly the manner in which escapes were made
was by the convicts when peat-cutting building up a
comrade in a peat-stack, but the warders are now too
much on the alert for this to take place successfully.</p>

<p>Such buildings as have been erected at Princetown
are ugly. The only structure that is not so is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
"Plume of Feathers," erected by the French prisoners.
Every other house is hideous, and most hideous of
all are the rows of residences recently erected for the
warders, for they are pretentious as well as ugly.</p>

<p>Yet Princetown may serve as a centre for excursions,
if the visitor can endure the intermittent rushes
of the trippers on their "cherry-bangs," and the persistent
presence of the convict. If he objects to
these, he can find accommodation a couple of miles
off, at Two Bridges; but if he desire creature comforts
he is sure of good entertainment at Princetown.</p>

<p>The group of remains at Merrivale Bridge is within
an easy walk. These are the most famous on
Dartmoor&mdash;not for their size or consequence, but
because most accessible, being beside the road. But
the whole collection is happily very complete.</p>

<p>There is a menhir, a so-called sacred circle, stone
rows, a kistvaen, a pound, hut circles, and a cairn.</p>

<p>The menhir was the starting-point of a stone row
that has been plundered for the construction of a
wall. The sacred circle is composed of very small
stones, and probably at one time inclosed a cairn.
The stone rows that exist are fairly perfect. Those
on the south, a double row, start from a cairn at
the west end that has been almost destroyed, and
end in blocking-stones to the east. They are, however,
interrupted by a small cairn within a ring of
stones, and, curiously enough, much as at Chagford,
another row starts near it at a tangent from a partly
destroyed cairn. The double row runs 849 feet.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 544px;">
<img src="images/p269.jpg" width="544" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>STAPLE TOR</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<p>The north pair of rows is imperfect; it probably
had a cairn at the west end, but of it no traces now
remain. It consists of a double row, and ends in a
blocking-stone at the east end. It can be traced
for only 590 feet.</p>

<p>A fine kistvaen, formerly in a cairn, lies to the
south of the southern pair of rows. A few years ago a
stonecutter at Merrivale Bridge took a gatepost out
of the coverer. In this kistvaen have been found,
though previously rifled, a flint knife and a polishing
stone. There were formerly two large cairns near,
but both have been destroyed by the road-makers,
as have also many of the hut circles; a good many,
however, yet remain, and some are inclosed within a
pound. In this ground is an apple-crusher, like an
upper millstone, that has been cut, but never removed,
because the demand for these stones ceased
with the introduction of the screw-press. Some ardent
but not experienced antiquaries have supposed it
to be a cromlech! As such it is figured in Major
Hamilton Smith's plan of the remains in 1828.</p>

<p>The tor Over Tor, on the right-hand side of the
road, was overthrown by some trippers&mdash;the first
swallows of a coming flight&mdash;early in the century.</p>

<p>The descent to Merrivale Bridge is fine; the bold
tors of Roos and Staple stand up grandly above the
Walkham river. Walkham, by the way, is Wallacombe,
the valley of the Walla.</p>

<p>The flank of Mis Tor towards the river is strewn
with inclosures and hut circles.</p>

<p>On Staple Tor is a so-called tolmen, a freak of
nature, unassisted by art. Cox Tor beyond is
crowned with cairns, but they have been rifled.</p>

<p>A very charming excursion may be made by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
following the Plymouth road to Peak Hill, then
descending to Hockworthy Bridge, and ascending
the river as best possible thence, by Woodtown to
Merrivale Bridge. There is a lane above Ward
Bridge that mounts the hillside on the east, and
commands a fine view of Vixen Tor with Staple
and Roos Tors behind. In the evening, when the
valley is in purple shade, a flood of golden glory
from the west illumines Vixen Tor, and this is the
true light in which the river should be ascended. A
so-called cyclopean bridge is passed that spans a
stream foaming down to join the Walkham.</p>

<p>Walkhampton church need not arrest the pedestrian;
it has a fine tower, but contains absolutely
nothing of interest. Adjoining the churchyard is,
however, a very early church house, probably more
ancient than the present Perpendicular church.</p>

<p>Sampford Spiney has its village church, a quaint,
small, old manor house, and a good tower to the
church. It is somewhat curious that the dedication
of neither of these churches is recorded.</p>

<p>Within an easy stroll of Princetown to the south
is Harter Tor. There are here many hut circles, and
below Harter Tor are stone avenues leading from
cairns.</p>

<p>Black Tor, that looks down on these remains, is
also above a blowing-house and miners' hut, not
of an ancient date, as it had a chimney and fireplace.
The mould-stone lies in the grass and weed.</p>

<p>Black Tor has on it a logan stone that can be
rocked by taking hold of a natural handle. On its
summit is a rock basin.</p>

</div>

<p>Tor Royal was built by Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt, and
there he entertained the Prince Regent when that
worthy visited Dartmoor. Tradition tells of high
revelry and debauches taking place on that occasion.
Sir Thomas planted trees that are doing fairly well.
In the valley of the West Dart, under Longaford
and Littaford Tors, is Wistman's Wood, now sadly
reduced in size. It has been assumed to be the last
remains of the forest that once covered Dartmoor.
But no forest ever did that; at all events no forest
of trees. The ashes of the fires used by the primitive
inhabitants show that peat was their principal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
fuel, and that what oak and alder they burned was
small and stunted.</p>

<p>In the sheltered combes doubtless trees grew, but
not to any height and size.</p>

<p>The early antiquaries, S. Rowe and E. Atkyns
Bray, talked much tall nonsense about Wistman's
Wood as a sacred grove, dedicated to the rites of
Druidism, and of the collection of mistletoe from
the boughs of the oaks. As it happens, there are
no prehistoric monuments near the wood to indicate
that it was held in reverence, and no mistletoe grows
in Devon, and in Somersetshire only on apple trees.
Indeed, the mistletoe will not grow higher than five
or six hundred feet above the sea, and Wistman's
Wood is not much less than a thousand feet above
the sea-level.</p>

<p>In July, 1882, the central portion of the wood
was set fire to, it was thought by trippers, in an
attempt to boil a kettle. This has helped to reduce
the ancient wood; but what prevents its increase is
the sheep, which eat the young trees as they shoot
up. It has been said that Wistman's Wood oaks
produce no acorns. This, however, is not the case.
The trees are so venerable that their power to bear
fruit is nearly over, yet they still produce some
acorns, and there are young oaks growing&mdash;but not
where sheep roam&mdash;that have come from these parent
stocks.</p>

<p>By ascending Bairdown, aiming for Lydford Tor,
and then following the ridge almost due north, but
with a little deflection to the west, Devil Tor may
be reached, and near this stands the most impressive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
menhir on the moor, the Bairdown Man. The height
is only twelve feet, but it is clothed in black lichen,
and stands in such a solitary spot that it inevitably
leaves an impression on the imagination. There is
no token of there having ever been a stone row in
connection with it.</p>

<p>It may here be noticed that the names Lydford
Tor, Littaford, Longaford, Belleford, Reddaford, do
not apply to any <em>fords</em> over the streams, which may
be crossed without difficulty, but take their appellation
from the Celtic <em>fordd</em>, "a way," and the tors
about the Cowsick and West Dart take their titles
from the great central causeway or from the Lych
Way that passed by them.</p>

<p>The portion of the Cowsick above Two Bridges
abounds in charming studies of river, rock, and
timber.</p>

<p>An excursion to Great Mis Tor will enable the
visitor to see a large rock basin, the Devil's Frying-pan
as it is called, and then, if he descends Greenaball,
where are cairns, he will see on the slope
opposite him, beyond the Walkham, a large village,
consisting of circular pounds and hut circles. On
reaching the summit of the hill he will see a fine
circle of upright stones. It was originally double,
but nearly all the stones forming the outer ring have
been removed. The rest were fallen, but have been
re-erected by His Grace the Duke of Bedford.</p>

<p>In such a case there can be no arbitrary restoration,
for the holes that served as sockets for the
stones can always be found, together with the trigger-stones.
Indeed, it is easy by the shape of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
socket-holes to see in which way the existing stones
were planted.</p>

<p>About half a mile to the north-west is the Langstone,
which gives its name to this down; it is of a
basaltic rock, and not, as is usual, of granite. Fice's
Well, which I remember in the midst of moor, is
now included within the newtake of the prisons,
and a wall has been erected to protect it. This
deprives it of much of its charm. It was erected
by John Fitz in 1568. Cut on the granite coverer
are the initials of John Fitz and the date.</p>

<p>The tradition is that John Fitz of Fitzford and his
lady were once pixy-led whilst on Dartmoor. After
long wandering in vain effort to find their way, they
dismounted to rest their horses by a pure spring that
bubbled up on a heathery hillside. There they
quenched their thirst; but the water did more than
that&mdash;it opened their eyes, and dispelled the pixy
glamour that had been cast over them, so that at
once they were able to take a right direction so as
to reach Tavistock before dark night fell. In gratitude
for this, John Fitz adorned the spring with a
granite structure, on which were cut in low-relief his
initials and the date of his adventure.</p>

<p>There are some old crosses that may be seen by
such as are interested in these venerable relics. The
Windy-post stands between Barn Hill and Feather
Tor, and there are also two on Whitchurch Down.
One of these, the more modern, of the fifteenth
century, has lost its shaft, and is reduced to a head;
but the other cross may, perhaps, date from the
seventh century&mdash;it may even be earlier. Whitchurch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
was an archpriesthood; there were two of these in
Devon and one in Cornwall. The origin of these
archpriesthoods is probably this.</p>

<p>In Celtic countries the king liked to have his
household priest, who ministered to the retinue and
to his family. On the other hand, the tribe had its
own saint, who was the ecclesiastical official for the
tribe and educated the young.</p>

<p>As the kings increased in power, and the old tribal
arrangement broke down, they had their household
priests consecrated bishops, and the tribal lands
were constituted their dioceses. But in Devon and
Cornwall this could not be, as the Saxons took all
power away from the native princes, and the Latin
ecclesiastics would not endure the peculiar ecclesiastical
organisation of the Celts. The household
priests of the conquered chieftains therefore simply
remained as archpriests. The Saxon and then the
Norman nobles were not averse from having their own
chaplains free from episcopal jurisdiction, and in some
places the archpriest remained on. But the bishops
did not like them, and one by one gobbled them up.
Whitchurch was regulated by Bishop Stapeldon in
1332. At present only one archpriesthood lingers on,
that of Haccombe. At an episcopal visitation, when
the name of the archpriest is recited by the episcopal
official, he does not respond, as to answer the citation
would be a recognition of the bishop's jurisdiction
over Haccombe. The very fine piece of screen in
Whitchurch was placed there by a former Lord
Devon. It comes from Moreton Hampstead. When
the dunderheads there cast it forth, the Earl secured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
it and placed it where it might be preserved and
valued. It is of excellent work.</p>

<p>Before laying down my pen I feel that I have not
done homage to that which, after all, gives the flavour
of poetry to the moorland&mdash;the heath and heather.
I was one day on the top of the coach from Holsworthy
to Bude, between two Scotch ladies, and I
put to them the question, "Which is heath and which
heather&mdash;that with the large, or that with the small
bells?" And Jennie, on my right, said: "The large
bell&mdash;that is heather"; but Grizel, on my left, said:
"Nay, the small bell&mdash;that is heather." As Scottish
women were undecided, I referred to books, and
take their decision. The large bell is heath; the ling,
that is heather.</p>

<p>In old times, so it is said, the Picts made of the
heather a most excellent beer, and the secret was
preserved among them. Leyden says that when
the Picts were exterminated, a father and son, who
alone survived, were brought before Kenneth the
Conqueror, who promised them life if they would
divulge the secret of heather ale. As they remained
silent, the son was put to death before the eyes of
his father. This exercise of cruelty failed in its
effect. "Sire," said the old Pict, "your threats might
have influenced my son, but they have no effect on
me." The king suffered the Pict to live, and the
secret remained untold.</p>

<p>Ah, weel! the Scotch make up for their loss upon
whisky.</p>

<p>A recent writer, referring to the story, says: "It is
just possible that the grain of truth contained in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
tradition may be, that all the northern nations, as the
Swedes still do, used the narcotic gale (<i lang="la">Myrica gale</i>),
which grows among the heather, to give bitterness
and strength to the barley beer; and hence the belief
that the beer was made chiefly of the heather itself."</p>

<p>I do not hold this. I suspect that the ale was
metheglin, made of the honey extracted from the
heather by the bees. Metheglin is still made round
Dartmoor, but it is only good and "heady" when
many years old. Avoid that which is younger than
three winters. When it is older, drink sparingly.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>It is quite certain that the ancient Irish brewed a
beer, which we can hardly think came from barley.
S. Bridget has left but one poetical composition
behind her, and that begins:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I should like a great lake of ale<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For the King of kings.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I should like the whole company of Heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To be drinking it eternally!"<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The heath was doubtless largely used in former
times, from the Prehistoric Age, not only as a thatch
for the huts and hovels, but as a litter for the beds.
Indeed, heath or heather is still employed in the
Scottish Highlands along with the peat earth as a
substitute for mortar between the stones of which
a cottage is built. And that heather was employed
for bedding who can question? Leather is tanned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
even better with heath than with oak-bark, and of it
a brilliant yellow dye is produced.</p>

<p>But&mdash;ah, me! the heath and the heather!&mdash;it is
not for the beer produced therefrom, not for the tan,
not for the dye, that we love it. Wonderful is the
sight of the moorside flushed with pink when the
heather is in bloom&mdash;it is as though, like a maiden,
it had suddenly awoke to the knowledge that it was
lovely, and blushed with surprise and pleasure at the
discovery.</p>

<p>But how short-lived is the heath!</p>

<p>It lies dead&mdash;a warm chocolate-brown, mantling
the hills from October till July. Only in the midsummer
does it timidly put forth its leaves&mdash;its
spines rather&mdash;and then it flushes again in September.
It blooms for about a fortnight, perhaps three
weeks, and then subsides into its brown winter sleep.
But what browns! what splendours of colour we have
when the fern is in its russet decay and the heather
is in its velvet sleep!</p>

<p>To him who wanders over the moor, and looks
at the flowers at his feet, some day comes the proud
felicity of lighting on the white heath&mdash;and that
found ensures happiness. And I, as I make my
<em>congé</em>, hand it to my reader with best wishes for his
enjoyment of that region I love best in the world.</p>

represented, either in complete works or in selections. It is the ambition of the publishers to
place the best books of the Anglo-Saxon race within the reach of every reader, so that the
series may represent something of the diversity and splendour of our English tongue. The
characteristics of <span class="smcap">The Standard Library</span> are four:&mdash;1. <span class="smcap">Soundness of Text.</span> 2. <span class="smcap">Cheapness.</span>
3. <span class="smcap">Clearness of Type.</span> 4. <span class="smcap">Simplicity.</span> The books are well printed on good paper at a
price which on the whole is without parallel in the history of publishing. Each volume contains
from 100 to 250 pages, and is issued in paper covers, Crown 8vo, at Sixpence net, or in
cloth gilt at One Shilling net. In a few cases long books are issued as Double Volumes

with questions of textual criticism or philology; but, taking the English
text in the Revised Version as their basis, they will try to combine a hearty acceptance
of critical principles with loyalty to the Catholic Faith.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
